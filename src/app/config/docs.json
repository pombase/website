The detailed views show descendant terms with ontology relations, and distinguish annotations to more or less specific terms.\n Example page (GO:0000070) and Documentation\n-  Improved summary views for annotation displays: On gene, genotype, term, and publication pages, the summary view is now non-redundant. See the gene page documentation, example pages above, and an example gene page (wee1) for more information.\n-  Phenotype annotation display filtering: The FYPO display on gene, genotype, and publication can be filtered to show annotation subsets based on broad phenotypic categories. See the gene page pheontype documentation and the example pages above for more information.\n-  Faster querying in the advanced search\n-  Front page research and community curation highlights\n\nWe thank the members of the fission yeast research community who have followed its progress via the preview site, and welcome feedback from all users.\n",

      "content" : "\n\nGeneral GO Slim hints\n\nThese points will help you understand GO slims, and highlight some features of the fission yeast slim terms and annotations.\n\n1.  Note that the counts in the “Genes” column of the GO slim tables are not additive, because many gene products are annotated to multiple terms.\n2.  It not possible to create a slim with no overlaps between terms. Although the S. pombe slim has been defined to include biologically informative terms, and minimise overlaps between terms, large overlaps cannot be entirely avoided. For example, most of the gene products annotated to signal transduction are also annotated other terms in the slim.\n3.  As a consequence of points 1 and 2, GO slim annotation summaries should not be presented using pie charts. Although a pie chart could show the fraction of total annotations for any slim term, it can too easily be mistaken for the fraction of total annotated gene products, which is not the same.\n4.  It is difficult to define a slim which includes all annotated gene products without including terms with very small numbers of annotations (for example, the peroxisome organization branch has very few annotations), or very high level terms which are not particularly biologically informative (e.g. cellular process). Because we have opted not to include such terms, some gene products are annotated to process terms but do not appear in the slim annotation set.\n5.  Bear in mind that both proteins and RNAs can be annotated to GO terms. If you are working only with proteins you will need to make adjustments for this. For example, many tRNAs and rRNAs are annotated to cytoplasmic translation, and are therefore included in the slim set.\n6.  There is a difference between “unknown” and “unannotated”. All fission yeast and budding yeast gene products have been assessed and are classed as “unknown” for biological process if no biological process information is found (experimental or inferred). If you are making comparisons with other organisms, remember that it is possible that not all gene products have been assessed and that the “unknown” set is underestimated.\n7.  The default S. pombe slim includes all evidence codes for fission yeast. The evidence code IEA (inferred from electronic annotation) is often considered to be less accurate than other evidence codes, but it is very useful for increasing the coverage of some of the high level GO terms. Accurate annotation counts for some terms currently depends on including this evidence code (for example, there are 16 gene products annotated to transmembrane transport with IEA evidence, which are not yet covered by a manual annotation). For fission yeast, the IEA annotations improve slim coverage, but only represent a small number of annotations (519 biological process annotations as of May 2020), and have a low rate of false positives. We therefore recommend that you include them.\n\nCreating a user-defined slim\n\n1.  You can create your own slim, or retrieve slim annotations for a gene set, using online slimming tools such as the GOTermMapper at Princeton or QuickGO Explore Biology at EBI (note that QuickGO requires UniProtKB accessions; PomBase IDs will not work).\n2.  When creating a slim for the entire genome, you should try to ensure that it covers as many annotated genes in your set as possible (see #3 in the list above). You should be aware of how many genes are annotated but not in your slim, and how many are “unknown” (i.e., annotated only to the root node; see #5 above).\n3.  For display purposes you usually want to keep the number of terms as small as possible to convey your results. However, you should ensure that the terms you include are specific enough to capture biologically relevant information. Many terms (e.g. metabolic process (3229 annotations), cellular process (4581 annotations)) are too general for the purpose of most slim-based analyses.\n4.  On a related note, if you are using your slim for data analysis (e.g. to summarize an enrichment), you should ensure that the terms are specific enough to demonstrate their relevance to the biological topic of interest. For example, lumping all genes involved in transport my mask overrepresentation of transmembrane transport vs. underrepresentation of vesicle-mediated transport in your results set, so you need to ensure that the slim has categories to represent your results effectively.\n5.  Most current implementations of software to create “GO slims” include the regulates relationship by default, so that (for example) genes involved in regulation of cytokinesis will be included with the set of genes annotated to cytokinesis. See the GO Ontology Relations documentation for further information about relationships in GO. The annotation totals presented for the PomBase default S. pombe process slim, by contrast, are calculated explicitly including the genes which are involved in a process via regulation only. We expect the distinction to be available in future versions of slimming software.\n",

Increasing numbers of new publications, and a large backlog of older papers, however, mean that complete literature curation will require input from the research community as well as the efforts of dedicated professional curators.\n\nThe PomBase Community Curation system enables researchers to contribute annotations directly to PomBase based on their publications using Canto, a web-based tool that allows both curators and researchers to create annotations. Canto supports GO, phenotype, interaction, and modification annotations, and can be configured for use with other ontologies as the need arises. Annotations made in the community curation system will be prioritized for inclusion in PomBase and will therefore also be more rapidly disseminated to other databases (e.g. GenBank/ENA/DDBJ, UniProtKB, BioGRID and GO), making data from annotated papers widely visible.\n\nHow to contribute: For newly published papers, PomBase curators email authors inviting them to participate, with specific instructions and links. Lab members are also welcome to evaluate existing annotations and create new annotations from past publications — use the PubMed ID search on the main PomBase Canto page. Anyone can also try the demo version of Canto.\n\nProgress and attribution: Curation statistics track S. pombe papers curated in Canto by PomBase and community curators, and the annotations obtained. Canto will soon allow contributors to register ORCID identifiers in the system, which will support more formalised attribution of community contributions to PomBase, and thereby enable researchers to cite community curation in institutional reports, funding applications, etc. To supplement the existing permanent publication-centred links in Canto, we are currently investigating possible ways to link to external resources such as ORCID or OpenRIF via ORCID IDs.\n\nFurther reading: For an in-depth analysis of our approach, and the status of community curation as of early 2019, see our publication:\n\nLock A, Harris MA, Rutherford K, Hayles J, Wood V.\nCommunity curation in PomBase: enabling fission yeast experts to provide detailed, standardized, sharable annotation from research publications.

      "content" : "\n\nOriginally sent by Val Wood to pombelist Fri Feb 4 12:08:34 GMT 2011\n\nA set of genome wide transcription start and termination sites manually\nannotated by Lantermann et. al in PMID: 20118936, based on\ntranscriptome data from Dutrow et. al. PMID: 18641648 have been used to\ncreate 5’ and 3’UTR features for the reference genome, for genes with no\npreviously annotated transcript from another source.\n\nThis increases the number of manually annotated UTRs from\n298 to 3605 for 5’\n778 to 3693 for 3’\n\nBecause it appears that transcription start and end can be fuzzy,\nthese features should be considered as an “indicator” of the likely\nextent of transcription. We will continue to revise the reference\ntranscript set as updates are reported, to represent the longest\ndiscrete transcript for a region as the consensus.\n\nData Access\nYou can access the transcription start and end from individual GeneDB\ngene pages for genes of interest using the sequence viewers GBrowse or\nArtemis. The links to these 2 browsers are to the right and left of the\n“context map” on the “Location” section of the gene page.\n(Artemis tips: Use the “Artemis applet” option selected; If you are\ninterested in a specific gene, reduce the upstream and downstream range\nof to 1000 before clicking “submit”; the page will take a few seconds\nto render the first time in a session)\n\nYou can download this data as part of the complete annotation in the “rich EMBL files” from here: ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/yeast/pombe/Chromosome_contigs/ (the files chromosome*.contig) and view them in Artemis on your desktop (see the Artemis FAQ and the Artemis manual (pdf; Sanger site) for additional information).\n\nHosting Further Transcriptome Datasets\nClearly, as more transcriptome data becomes available the community will\nrequire access to the different datasets, in addition to the consensus\ntranscripts. We intend to provide this in the future through the new\nPomBase using the Ensembl viewer.\n",

      "content" : "\n\nNote: This documentation is still a work in progress. Please contact the helpdesk if you have any questions.\n\nThe PomBase advanced search allows you to construct complex queries for S. pombe genes. At present all advanced search results are lists of genes that match the query specifications. Hints for specific searches are available in the PomBase FAQ, and linked below.\n\nOverview\n\nIn the Search menu, choose Advanced (or bookmark http://www.pombase.org/query).\n\nIn the Query panel (top), click one of the links in the list on the left to choose a query type. For each query, the interface guides your input.\n\n[advanced search page with new query]\n\nIn the History panel (bottom), queries are listed in reverse chronological order (most recently run first). Results are linked in the Count column; the link goes to a page that displays the gene name, systematic ID, and product description for matching genes. The Download button offers additional options, including nucleotide and (where applicable) protein sequence. To return to the search page, use the blue “<- ” button just above the result list, not your browser’s “Back” button.\n\nYou can select queries in the list to combine or delete them. To combine queries, you must select two or more from the list, and then click one of the operator buttons:\n\n[advanced search page with new query]\n\nResults are added to the history list:\n\n[advanced search page with new query]\n\nQueries using the NOT operator default place the more recently run query first (newer NOT/Subtract older):\n\n[advanced search page with new query]\n\nClick “Change direction” to switch the order. Click “Submit” to run the query.\n\nYou can also move any query to the top of the history list by clicking its “Results” link.\n\nQuery results can remain available in the history list for several days. If changes in annotation cause results to change since a query was last run, the entry in the history list will be labeled “out of date”:\n\n[advanced search page with out-of-date query]\n\nClick on the “Results” link to re-run the query and retrieve the up-to-date result.\n\nIf the parameters for a query are not all visible in the history, a “[details]” toggle (1) to show or hide additional details will appear. You can also edit the name that appears in the history list (2). The name will be used as part of the description when the query is used in any combined query (which can, in turn, be given a new name).\n\n[advanced search query name and details]\n\nQuery results page\n\nClicking on any up-to-date count in the “Results” column goes to a page that shows the count, query details, and a list of matching genes.\n\n[advanced search results page]\n\n1.  Return to the main  page (you can also use the browser “back” button)\n\n2.  Click on a header to sort by the column\n\n3.  Select columns to display. A set of gene expression data sets are hidden by default; click “Show gene expression columns” to reveal the additional options.\n\n4.  Select from the pulldown to send the gene list to QuiLT for visualisation, or, for lists of up to 150 genes, see the genes highlighted in violin plots of quantitative expression datasets. (At present data from Marguerat S et al. (2012) and Carpy A et al. (2014) are included.)\n\n5.  Show GO slim annotations for genes in the list. Click “Slim with” to reveal a dropdown, and choose a slim. Note: when you return to the main  page, the query history will include an entry showing the query as a gene list. This is harmless.\n\n6.  Narrow the list: click the button to reveal checkboxes\n\n7.  Download selected data for genes in the list. The popup offers three sets of options:\n\n-  The default “Tab delimited” view offers a set of details that can be included in a downloaded text file. Click “Show gene expression columns” to reveal additional options.\n -  Use the “Sequence” tab to retrieve amino acid or nucleotide sequences in FASTA format. Use the checkboxes to select which items are included in the headers. When “Nucleotide” is selected, flanking sequence options similar to those on the gene page are available.\n -  In the “GO Annotation” tab, you can choose which ontologies to include. Downloaded annotations are in GAF 2.1 format. Note that only “direct”, not inferred, annotations are included, as described in this FAQ.\n\nSharing search results\n\nEach results page has a stable, unique URL that you can bookmark, copy/paste, and share. Anyone who follows a shared link will see the same results page, and the query will be added to their query history.\n\nThe “Visualise” and “Slim” options also generate stable, unique, sharable URLs.\n\nQuery types\n\nOntology queries (GO, phenotype, protein modification, and protein sequence feature) retrieve genes that are annotated to the selected term(s), and to their descendants via specified relations (see the GO documentation on Ontology Structure and Ontology Relations for more information on relationships between terms in ontologies, and see the descriptions below of specific ontology filters for lists of which relations are followed to retrieve annotations). Ontologies can be searched by ID or term name. Type or paste a complete ontology ID, including the prefix (e.g. GO:0005634, FYPO:0002059), or simply start typing to search for a term name. Choose a term from the list of options offered by the autocomplete, and click “Submit”.\n\nNote: Only terms that are used in annotations (direct or inferred by transitivity) will appear as autocomplete suggestions. This is to avoid having irrelevant terms, such as “chloroplast” or “echolocation” appearing. Any term without annotations can be found by searching by its ID, and will appear in the query history with “0” results.\n\nCommonly used queries\n\nThis item offers convenient links to perform frequently used queries easily. Click on the query description to add the results to the query history.\n\nPlease contact the helpdesk if you would like any queries added to the selection.\n\nGene names and IDs\n\nType or paste a list of gene names or systematic IDs (or a mixture), or click the “Browse” button to select a file to upload. Click “Lookup” to add the gene list to the history (useful for combining the list with other queries).\n\nGO\n\nThe Gene Ontology (GO) query retrieves gene products annotated to a GO term and to any of its child terms, following the is_a, part_of, regulates, positively_regulates,and negatively_regulates relationships in the ontology. You may also find it helpful to search or browse in QuickGO or AmiGO to find GO terms of interest. If one search does not seem to retrieve as many results as you expect, try again using a less specific term. Note: prior to the November 2014 PomBase release, the regulates relations were not followed, and PomBase GO search results therefore did not match those in AmiGO.\n\nPhenotype\n\nThe phenotype (Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology) query retrieves genes annotated to a FYPO term and to any of its child terms, following the is_a, part_of, output_of, has_output, and has_part relationships in the ontology. This query also offers three additional sets of options:\n\n[phenotype search options]\n\nAlleles: By default, the phenotype search retrieves genes from single-allele genotypes annotated to the searched FYPO term. You can alter the selected options to add genes from multi-allele genotypes. See the gene page phenotype documentation and the genotype page documentation for more information.\n\nExpression: Different alleles of one gene may have different phenotypes, and one allele may give rise to different phenotypes under different experimental conditions. At present, you can retrieve annotations for all alleles of a gene, or use the “Expression level” options restrict the query to null alleles (covers deletions and any other sequence changes, such as most disruptions, that completely abolish expression of the gene) or overexpression of the wild type allele.\n\nConditions: The “Constrain condition” option restricts the results to include only genes that have phenotype annotations including the specified condition. The search uses the same condition descriptors as Canto and the PomBase web pages. Start typing, then choose from the autocomplete options.\n\nNote that the results will include any gene that has phenotype annotations including the specified condition for any allele. Queries that include conditions can be combined using the AND, NOT, or OR operators like any other, but the result of any combination of phenotype queries will likely include annotations for different alleles. There may not be any individual annotation in which both/all of multiple conditions co-occur.\n\nThe search does not yet support querying for multiple conditions on the same annotation, nor for queries that exclude a given condition; both are planned for future development.\n\nProduct type\n\nChoose a gene product type (e.g. protein coding, tRNA, etc.) from the pulldown menu.\n\nProtein modification\n\nSearch for terms or IDs in the PSI-MOD ontology.\n\nProtein domain\n\nSearch for an ID from Pfam, PRINTs, PROFILE, ProSite, or InterPro. Type or paste an accession and click “Submit”.\n\nProtein feature\n\nThis query searches for terms or IDs in the Sequence Ontology and retrieves protein-coding genes where the protein has the feature represented by the SO term (e.g. KEN box SO:0001807 ).\n\nProtein length\n\nFind protein-coding genes with products in a specified length range. Enter the desired minimum and maximum length and click “Search”.\n\nProtein mol. weight\n\nFind protein-coding genes with products in a specified mass range. Enter the desired minimum and maximum mass in kiloDaltons (kDa) and click “Search”.\n\nDisease\n\nSearch the Monarch Disease Ontology to find S. pombe genes whose human orthologs have been implicated in disease. Start typing ‘disease’ or the name of a specific disease, and choose from the autocomplete options. To retrieve all disease-associated genes, type or paste “MONDO:0000001”.\n\nNumber of TM domains\n\nFind protein-coding genes with products that have a specified number of transmembrane domains. Enter the desired minimum and maximum number and click “Search”.\n\nGenome location\n\nFind genes in a specified region of a chromosome. Select a chromosome from the pulldown, and click “Search” to retrieve all genes on the chromosome. Optional: enter start and end coordinates in the boxes to retrieve only genes in the indicated region.\n\nNumber of exons\n\nFind genes with a specified number of coding exons in the primary transcript (note: at present this query does not consider any annotated alternative transcripts). Enter the desired minimum and maximum number and click “Search”.\n\nNumber of transcripts\n\nFind genes with a specified number of annotated transcripts; genes with two or more have one or more alternative transcripts in addition to the primary transcript. Enter the desired minimum and maximum number and click “Search”.\n\nTaxonomic conservation\n\nChoose one of the descriptions from the pulldown menu. See the gene page documentation for more information.\n\nCharacterisation status\n\nChoose one of the descriptions from the pulldown menu. See the gene characterisation page for more information.\n\nSearch tips\n\nFAQ entries relevant to using the advanced search are organised here by topic. Several of the topics also correspond to gene page sections.\n\nPhenotype searches\n\n-  Can I get a list of essential pombe genes?\n-  How can I find all of the genes that have a given mutant phenotype?\n-  Why are some genes annotated to both viable and inviable phenotypes?\n-  How can I browse the phenotype ontology (FYPO)?\n\nGene Ontology searches\n\n-  How can I search or browse GO annotations?\n-  How can I find genes with a specific activity?\n-  How can I find protein localization data?\n-  How can I identify all of the genes that affect a process?

      "content" : "\n\nPomBase uses the Gene Ontology (GO) to describe the biological context of genes.\n\nGO consists of three distinct ontologies (or sets of vocabularies) that describe a gene’s:\n\n1.  Molecular Function (MF) — single-step activities such as kinase activity or transporter activity\n2.  Biological Process (BP) — a series of functions with a common goal such as MAPK cascade or cytokinesis\n3.  Cellular component (CC) — the location where the gene product can be found, and what complexes it is part of, for instance nucleus or fatty acid synthase complex\n\nA gene product may be annotated to several GO terms from each of the three ontologies; mcm3, for instance, is annotated to ATP-dependent DNA helicase activity, ATP binding, and DNA replication origin binding (MFs), it acts in mitotic DNA replication initiation and negatively regulates the MCM helicase activity (BPs), and is found locations including the replication fork and the pre-replicative complex (CC).\n\nEach table includes ontology term details and supporting data. The GO annotation display on PomBase gene pages includes ontology term details and supporting data. The summary view shows just the essentials: The list of terms is filtered, using the ontology structure, so that it shows only the most specific terms used to annotate a genotype, and each unique combination of gene, GO term, and extension(s) is shown once:\n\n[summary gene page GO annotations]\n\n1.  The GO term name, which links to a page with additional information, including the term definition, any synonyms, relationships to other GO terms, and annotations to the term or its descendants. (See the PomBase ontology term page documentation and the GO documentation on the GO graph and Relations in GO for more information.)\n2.  GO Slim terms applicable to the gene.\n3.  GO annotations may have extensions to capture any of several types of additional detail. S. pombe genes link to PomBase gene pages, and ontology term names link to ontology term pages.\n\nThe detailed view shows annotations to all GO terms, and includes more details for each annotation. It shows separate entries for repeat determinations of a given gene/term/extension combination (if supported by more than one line of evidence and/or reported in more than one paper), and annotations to terms hidden in the summary view:\n\n[full gene page GO annotations]\n\n1.  The unique ID and name for a GO term, linked to an ontology term page as described above.\n\n2.  An abbreviation (code) for the type of (see “Evidence codes” below) that supports the annotation. The evidence categories come from the set of evidence codes defined by the GO Consortium.\n\n3.  An additional ontology term or identifier that provides supporting details for annotations using certain evidence codes (see below and GO documentation).\n\n4.  An optional qualifier that modifies the connection between the gene product and the GO term. Entries come from the set of allowed qualifiers described in GO’s annotation overview or internal PomBase usage.\n\n5.  The paper from which the annotation comes.\n\n6.  The number of genes annotated to the term, linked to an ontology term page as described above.\n\n7.  GO Slim terms applicable to the gene.\n\n8.  GO annotations may have extensions(see “Annotation extensions” below) to capture any of several types of additional detail. S. pombe genes link to PomBase gene pages. Protein Ontology (PRO) terms, which identify specific processed or modified forms of a protein, can be used in extensions or to indicate which form is active; both are displayed here.\n\nTerm ID and name\n\nAnnotations are made to the definition of a term, not the term name itself, so we recommend that users always read the term definition. The definition of a term can be found on the ontology term page linked to the term name and ID.\n\nGO Structure\n\nGO is structured in a hierarchal order with less specific terms being parents of more specific child terms. A child term may have multiple parents and multiple children; the BP mitotic sister chromatid segregation, for instance, has child terms representing each part of the segregation process (sister chromatid cohesion, separation, etc.) as well as parent terms connecting it to both the mitotic cell cycle and chromosome segregation. Crucially, whenever an annotation is made to a term, the gene product is automatically annotated to all the parent terms. The ancestry of a term can be viewed in browsers such as AmiGO or QuickGO, accessible via links on the ontology term page. For more information, see the GO graph documentation.\n\nMultiple relationships exist to describe the links within the ontologies. A child term can have an is_a relation to the parent term, where the child is a more specific type of the parent, or a part_of relationship where the child makes up a part of the parent. For instance, the mitochondrion is_a intracellular organelle and is part_of a cell. Additionally, GO also include regulatory relationships. For more information on relationships in GO, see the Relations in GO documentation.\n\nEvidence codes\n\nIn PomBase, every annotation is supported by a reference that states where the annotation comes from, and an evidence code that describes the type of data that supports the annotation. An annotation may be inferred from experimental ‘wet lab’ data, backed by a literature reference and citing experimental evidence such as IDA (Inferred from Direct Assay) or IMP (Inferred from Mutant Phenotype). Further information on evidence codes is available in the GO Evidence Codes documentation.\n\nAnother source of annotations come from computational methods. Please note that all computational annotations are based on predictions. In cases where a sequence model has been used to annotate genes, but the genes annotated based on the model have not been manually checked, the IEA (Inferred from Electronic Annotation) evidence code is assigned. If the annotations have been manually checked other evidence codes may be used, for instance ISO (Inferred from Sequence Orthology) or ISM (Inferred from Sequence Model). PomBase uses ISO to cross-reference to the roles of known S. cerevisiae genes, and uses ISM when domains present in a gene product can give clues to its biological role.\n\nFor some types of evidence, such as sequence comparisons or interaction data, it is important to note what gene or gene product was used in the comparison or detected in the interaction. In these cases the With/From column provides more information regarding the source of the information.\n\nAnnotation extensions\n\nWhere available, annotation extensions are displayed underneath the GO term name. The extensions provide additional specificity to the annotation by linking the term to another ontology term or a gene product via a relationship. Examples include specifying substrates of molecular functions or specifying the cellular localization during a process (for instance, pka1 has protein serine/threonine kinase activity and has the substrates mei3 and rst2. It is a cellular component of the nucleus during nitrogen starvation, but found in the vacuole during glucose starvation).\n\nThe GO Consortium provides further information on annotation extensions in its file format guide, on a wiki page, and in publications from 2014 and 2017. PomBase converts many extension names to more human-friendly text, as described here.\n\nIf an extension mentions another S. pombe gene, the extension data will also be displayed as an annotation in the “Target of” section of the page for that gene.\n\nPRO terms can be used in extensions, and PRO terms that are used to associate a GO annotation with a specific modified or processed form are also listed with annotation extensions. In both cases, PRO IDs link to Protein Ontology web pages. Note that PomBase uses human-friendly display names that differ from the full names on the PRO pages; abbreviations used in the display names are included in the extension display documentation.\n\nFinding other genes annotated to a specific GO term\n\nFrom a gene page, all S. pombe genes annotated to a term (or its children) can be found by clicking on a term name or ID to reach the ontology term page.\n\nAdditionally, the advanced search can be used to search for all genes annotated to a particular GO term (see the advanced search documentation for more information). To find annotations to specific GO terms in organisms other than S. pombe we recommend using AmiGO or QuickGO.\n",

The extensions provide additional specificity to the annotation, often by linking the term to another ontology term or a gene product via a relationship. Examples include specifying the gene product that adds or removes a modification, specifying modified residues, or specifying that the modification is observed during a phase or process. For example, Lys4 (shown above) is phosphorylated on a serine residue during M phase of the mitotic cell cycle. Likewise, Cdc2 is phosphorylated during G2, and phosphorylated on Tyrosine 15 by Wee1; it is phosphorylated during G2 but not M phase of the mitotic cell cycle; other extensions are also available for Cdc2.\n\nThe annotation extension field can also be used to indicate modification site occupancy, for experiments that measure the proportion of copies of the protein (or RNA) that have the modification.\n\nNote: unlike GO annotations, for modification annotations extensions are not considered for display filtering. Annotations to less specific terms are hidden in the summary view whether they have extensions or not.\n",

      "content" : "\n\nPomBase defines a phenotype as an observable characteristic, or set of characteristics, of an organism that results from the interaction of its genotype with a given environment. In PomBase, phenotypes are annotated using terms from the Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO). FYPO uses several existing ontologies from the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) collection to construct formal definitions. Basic documentation for FYPO is available at the OBO Foundry, and further information is available on the PomBase wiki.\n\nIn the phenotype annotation display on PomBase gene pages, the first item shown is a brief summary indicating whether cells with a null (deletion) allele of the gene are viable or inviable, or either depending on experimental conditions. Next, single-locus phenotypes are shown in two tables. The first table lists phenotypes observed at the population level, such as viability in culture, and the second shows cell-level phenotypes. Note that the viable/inviable population terms describe whether a gene is essential or not, and see the wiki FYPO Content and Structure documentation for more information on cell and population phenotypes. Finally, two more tables list population-level and cell-level multi-locus phenotypes, i.e. phenotypes associated with double mutants, triple mutants, etc, and the relevant genotype details.

Targets or substrates of biochemical activity (e.g. protein kinases or phosphatases, protein methyltransferases, ubiquitin-protein ligases). When one protein is shown experimentally to modify another, a GO molecular function annotation represents the activity, and the target(s) can be captured using annotation extensions. For example, Cdc2 phosphorylates Cut3, so it is annotated to ‘protein serine/threonine kinase activity’ with the extension ‘has substrate cut3’.\n3.  GO protein complex annotations.

In the Expression column, use one of these values: ‘overexpression’, ‘knockdown’, ‘endogenous’, ‘null’, ‘not specified’. Deletions should always have ‘null’ expression.\n5.  The Parental strain column is for the parental strain designation, such as 972 h-, 975 h+, etc. This column must be filled in, but you can use “unknown” if you don’t know the original background.\n6.  Use the Strain name (background) column for a lab’s in-house name/ID/designation for the background strain (i.e. the derivative of the parental strain that has selectable marker alleles etc.). The description in the Genotype column should match this background strain.\n7.  The Genotype description column is for alleles in the background, such as selectable markers; these details are optional.

You are welcome to enquire with us in advance to find out which ECO terms/IDs fit your experiments, but we can accept files with brief descriptions (such as those in the Canto phenotype evidence option list), which curators will convert to ECO IDs.\n13. Similarly, Conditions use a small ontology maintained in-house by PomBase curators, and we can either advise you about which terms/IDs to use, or convert from text to IDs when we receive your file. Use multiple entries in cases where more than one condition detail applies at the same time (e.g. high temperature, minimal medium). Separate multiple entries with commas (,). Use separate lines if a phenotype is observed under more than one set of conditions (e.g. high and low temperature).\n14. Penetrance describes the proportion of a population that shows a cell-level phenotype. Use decimals, percents, or “high” (above 80%), “medium” (20-80%), or “low” (less than 20%). We will convert to suitable IDs for loading. Penetrance data will be displayed as annotation extensions on gene pages.\n15. Severity (formerly designated “expressivity) uses”high\" (synonym: strong), “medium”, or “low” (synonym: weak). We will convert to suitable IDs for loading. Severity data will be displayed as annotation extensions on gene pages.\n16. The Extension column can be used to record when a mutation in one gene affects another gene or its product. For example, if a mutation in gene A decreases its ability to phosphorylate protein B, you can use the phenotype “decreased protein kinase activity” and put the ID for gene B in an extension. Multiple extensions can be included for a phenotype annotation. Separate extensions with a comma (,) if they combine to form a “compound” extension (two or more genes assayed together), or with a pipe (|) if they are independent. Most phenotype extensions will be independent and pipe-separated.\n17. The Reference column has the publication’s PubMed ID (PMID).\n18. The taxon will usually be 4896 (the NCBI taxon ID for Schizosaccharomyces pombe), although if you have an NCBI taxon ID for a specific S. pombe strain you are welcome to use it\n19.

Slims can offer a useful overview of a genome or the results of a large-scale experiment. For more information on GO slims, please see PomBase GO Slimming Tips and the GO Subset Guide at the Gene Ontology website.\n\nPomBase provides a GO slim term set for each major branch of GO:\n\n-  GO molecular function slim term set\n-  GO biological process slim term set\n-  GO cellular component slim term set\n\nEach fission yeast GO slim has been constructed to optimise coverage of gene products annotated to terms in the branch of GO. For the biological process and cellular component branches, coverage is almost complete; the molecular function branch has somewhat lower coverage. These slims provide good starting points for users who wish to identify terms of biological interest to create a “custom slim”, or to become familiar with the genome contents.\n\nIn the GO slim tables, GO IDs link to the QuickGO browser, where you can explore the ontology and annotations further. The annotation totals include annotations to the slim term and to descendants following the is_a, part_of, regulates, positively_regulates, and negatively_regulates relationships, and link to gene lists. (Note: the cellular component ontology does not contain any “regulates” links.)\n\nThe GO biological process slim table also includes links to visualisations in esyN for the physical interaction network of genes annotated to each term.\n\nThe bottom of each GO slim page lists some simple statistics: the total number of gene products annotated to slim terms, and the number of protein-coding gene products not covered by the slim, either because they are not annotated to any term in the GO branch, or because they have annotations to terms not covered by the slim.\n\nCurrent GO slim IDs and term names can be downloaded from the PomBase ftp site:\n\n-  GO molecular function slim\n-  GO biological process slim\n-  GO cellular component slim\n",

To return to the previous page, use the “Finish visualisation” button.\n\nAdding and sorting annotations\n\nIn the QuiLT display, each row represents a single gene, and each column is an annotation type.\n\nUse the checkboxes (1) to toggle an annotation type on and off. When annotations are shown, a link appears to sort on that annotation type. You may want to try different combinations of which types are shown, and which used to sort the list, until you get a display you like. You can download the graph (with key) in SVG format at any time (2). The key (4) shows only terms used to annotate genes in the list, so for small gene lists not all terms may appear.\n\nClick on a row to select a single gene, or click on a box in any column (3) to select all genes in it. In the displayed gene list, you can clear the selection (5) or use the “Filter” button (6) to create a new gene list from the selection (which you can then visualise in QuiLT).\n\nSharing results\n\nEach QuiLT visualisation page has a stable, unique URL that you can bookmark, copy/paste, and share. Anyone who follows a shared link will see QuiLT displaying the same gene list. Clicking the “Advanced Search” button adds a query that would produce the gene list to the query history.\n\nAvailable annotation types\n\nAt present, QuiLT includes:\n\n-  Deletion viability\n-  Presence or absence of budding yeast orthologs\n-  Presence or absence of human orthologs\n-  GO biological process\n-  GO cellular component\n-  GO molecular function\n-  Characterization status for protein-coding genes\n-  Taxonomic distribution\n-  Protein length\n\nGO annotation precedence\n\nIn each branch of GO, only one term can be included for display.

The database that produced the file – included to facilitate data sharing with other databases. Obviously always PomBase for this file.\n2.  The systematic ID for each gene.\n3.  To use the FYPO IDs, see the FYPO summary page and the FAQ on browsing FYPO.\n4.  The allele description specifically describes the change; see the Phenotype data bulk upload format for details on allele types and descriptions.\n5.  The Expression column contains one of these values: ‘overexpression’, ‘knockdown’, ‘endogenous’, ‘null’, ‘not specified’. Deletions always have ‘null’ expression.\n6.  The Parental strain column is for the parental strain designation, such as 972 h-, 975 h+, etc. This column must be filled in, but “unknown” is allowed.\n7.  The Background strain name column is used for a lab’s in-house name/ID/designation for the background strain (i.e. the derivative of the parental strain that has selectable marker alleles etc.). The description in the Genotype column should match this background strain.\n8.  The Background genotype description column is for alleles in the background, such as selectable markers; these details are optional. To avoid redundancy, it does not repeat the allele of interest (from column 4 or 10) in the genotype column.\n9.  Gene names are optional for upload, but are included where available in the download.\n10. Allele names are optional for upload, but are included where available in the download. Column 10 lists the preferred allele name, and any alternative names are in column 11.\n11. See note 10 above. Multiple entries are separated with pipes (|).\n12. Allowed allele types, example descriptions, etc. are shown in the table at the bottom of the Phenotype data bulk upload format page.\n13. For the Evidence column, we use a small selection from the Evidence Ontology (ECO). Please contact the Helpdesk if you need assistance using these IDs\n14. Similarly, Conditions use a small ontology maintained in-house by PomBase curators, and we can help you interpret the IDs. Multiple entries are shown in cases where more than one condition detail applies at the same time (e.g. high temperature, minimal medium), and are separated with commas (,).\n15. Penetrance describes the proportion of a population that shows a cell-level phenotype. Penetrance data are represented as percents or entries from the in-house FYPO_EXT ontology (FYPO_EXT:0000001 = high; FYPO_EXT:0000002 = medium; FYPO_EXT:0000003 = low; FYPO_EXT:0000004 = full).\n16. Severity (formerly designated “expressivity”) uses the FYPO_EXT ontology described in note 15.\n17. The Extension column is used to record when a mutation in one gene affects another gene or its product. For example, if a mutation in gene A decreases its ability to phosphorylate protein B, the A allele is annotated to the phenotype “decreased protein kinase activity” with the ID for gene B in an extension. In the downloadable file, an annotation can have multiple comma-separated extensions if they combine to form a “compound” extension (e.g. two or more genes assayed together).\n18. The Reference column has the publication’s PubMed ID (PMID).\n19. The taxon will usually be 4896 (the NCBI taxon ID for Schizosaccharomyces pombe), although an NCBI taxon ID for a specific S. pombe strain would be allowed.\n20. The date is the date on which the annotations are created. Format: YYYY-MM-DD\n",

Paste your gene list into the “Gene names and IDs” query, and then combine it with a GO query for each term of interest (see the search documentation for more information).\n\n-  If you are interested in many GO terms, or if you do not know in advance which terms may be relevant, we recommend that you use a “GO term enrichment” tool. Such tools are typically used to find terms overrepresented for a gene list, but can be used to retrieve all GO annotations if the p-value threshold is set artificially high.\n\nBoth the Advanced Search and term enrichment tools take advantage of the hierarchical structure of GO, such that annotations to specific terms are propagated to “ancestor” terms via is_a and part_of relations.

      "content" : "\n\nAs described in detail in this online tutorial (external link) provided by the Nielsen lab, S. pombe switch between the two mating types M and P.\n\nGenetic information encoded by the mat1 locus determines the mating type: if this locus contains the Pc and Pi genes, the cell is mating type P, and if it contains the Mc and Mi genes the cell is mating type M. Additionally, S. pombe contains two silent loci: mat2 and mat3. These loci are not expressed but host the information needed for each mating type configuration. Mat2 contains the two genes Pc and Pi, and Mat3 contains the two genes Mc and Mi. Recombinational DNA repair during mitotic cell division ensures production of one daughter cell of parental mating type and one daughter of the opposite mating type.\n\nA wild type S. pombe cell thus contains 6 mating type specific genes: 1. mat1-P/Mc - expressed 2. mat1-P/Mi - expressed 3. mat2-Pc - silent 4. mat2-Pi - silent 5. mat3-Mc - silent 6. mat3-Mi - silent\n\nThe sequenced S. pombe reference strain (972 h-) is in the M mating type configuration (encodes the Mc and Mi genes at the mat1 locus). The mat2 genes are deleted in this strain for technical reasons, whereas the mat3 genes are intact.\n\nThe DNA seqence of the WT silent mating type region containing the mat2 and mat3 genes was reconstructed yielding an extra mating type region contig (see ‘current genome’ link). Only the P genes from this contig have gene pages in PomBase.\n\nThe systematic IDs and contig source of the mating type specific genes are: 1. mat1-Mc - SPBC23G7.09 (from the chromosome 2 contig) 2. mat1-Mi - SPBC23G7.17c (from the chromosome 2 contig) 3. mat2-Pc - SPMTR.01 (from the mating type contig) 4. mat2-Pi - SPMTR.02 (from the mating type contig) 5. mat3-Mc - SPBC1711.02 (from the chromosome 2 contig) 6. mat3-Mi - SPBC1711.01c (from the chromosome 2 contig)\n\nThe duplicate M genes without gene pages are: 7. mat3-Mc - SPMTR.04 (extra copy from the mating type contig) 8. mat3-Mi - SPMTR.03 (extra copy from the mating type contig)\n\nFor the M specific genes, functional annotation (GO, phenotypes…) is attached to the mat1-Mc and mat1-Mi genes. For the P specific genes, functional annotation is attached to mat2-Pc and mat2-Pi out of necessity (the reference strain is in the M configuration).\n",

The linked page includes a list of orthologs, and links to phylogenetic tree views that can also display alignments. Help is available.\n\nCompara\n\nYou can search for orthologs/paralogs in Fungi, or in a pan-taxonomic comparison (eukaryotes), using Compara in the Ensembl browser.\n\n1.  On any gene page, follow the link to the Ensembl genome browser under Orthologs or External References.\n\n2.  Click the “Gene:” tab to show Compara links in the left-hand margin - for fungal alignments, choose “Fungal Compara”, or for all eukaryotic species choose “Pan-taxonomic Compara”.\n\n3.  You should see a “collapsed” gene tree highlighting your fission yeast gene of interest. From here you can click on any node to see a menu of options:\n\n1.  Expand or collapes specific sub-nodes of the tree, or expand the tree fully\n 2.  View the alignment in FASTA format\n 3.  Launch the jalview multiple alignment viewer to see the full alignment and colour by residue conservation, hydrophobicity, etc.\n\n4.  To configure the protein entries visible in the alignment, select the most “inclusive” node you require. You can reduce the number of entries by collapsing individual sub-trees before you generate your alignment.\n\nInformation about how the Compara trees are generated, homology types, and species is available from the Ensembl comparative genomics documentation.\n\nPSI-BLAST\n\nTo search for putative orthologs not fund in DIOPT or Compara, we recomment PSI-BLAST (Position-Specific Iterated BLAST) at NCBI or EBI. As described in the NCBI tutorial, PSI-BLAST derives a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) or profile from the multiple sequence alignment of sequences detected above a given score threshold using protein–protein BLAST.\n",

You can also use the GO Term Finder to retrieve all annotations for your gene list by setting the p-value to 1.\n\nBefore you perform an enrichment analysis, we recommend that you do a GO slim analysis of your gene list, for a broad overview of the annotation set (for more information, see the Fission Yeast GO slim documentation page and FAQ). You can use Princeton’s GO slimming tool, GO Term Mapper, which is especially useful if you use your own GAF for the enrichment, because it will show:\n\n-  IDs in your gene list that are missing from the annotation set (the annotations in GO Term Mapper’s database or your uploaded GAF)\n-  Genes in your list that have annotations but do not map to the slim\n-  Genes in your list that have no annotations\n\nA few other enrichment tools are described on the GO Consortium’s GO Enrichment Analysis page. If you choose one of these, we recommend that you only use an enrichment tool that allows you to upload a background set representing the genes used in your experiment. Even if you regard the whole genome as the relevant background, it is important to specify the background gene set explicitly to obtain meaningful results, especially if you have data only for protein-coding genes. For example, annotated tRNA genes can obscure enrichment of protein-coding genes annotated to translation.\n\nFor any GO analysis, we strongly recommend that you describe your approach fully in methods, and include the release details (number and/or date) for PomBase and the GO terms and annotations you use.\n",

FYPO annotations indicate when a mutation in a gene causes a change in a process, but do not say whether the effect is direct or indirect.\n\nMany mutant phenotypes reflect downstream effects of compromising an upstream process. In these cases, we annotate the phenotypes using FYPO terms, but do not annotate to the GO corresponding biological process term. We use “regulation of biological process” GO terms in cases where there is evidence for a gene playing a regulatory role in wild-type cells, but not where defects in an upstream process affect a downstream process (even though the latter is sometimes described as “regulating” or “modulating” the downstream process).\n\nFor example, a defect in cellular respiration may arise from mutations in genes directly involved in respiration, but also as a downstream effect of mutations in genes involved in mitochondrial translation, respiratory chain complex assembly, or ubiquinone biosynthesis. Similarly, DNA replication defects often also lead to defects in chromosome segregation; for the genes involved we annotate both replication and segregation phenotypes, but only replication in GO biological process.\n\nThe cell cycle offers an even more dramatic example of why we restrict usage of GO annotations. Over 750 genes can be mutated to give an elongated vegetative cell phenotype, which is traditionally interpreted as indicating that cell cycle progression is blocked in interphase. Most of these genes, however, are involved in transcription, translation, transport or splicing, and cell cycle delays seen in mutants are due to activation of cell cycle checkpoints by the abnormal processes. To annotate all 750 genes to “regulation of mitotic cell cycle” would obscure the genes that actually are part of the cell cycle regulatory network, greatly reducing the usefulness and precision of GO annotations.\n\nAlso see the FAQ on finding genes that affect a process.\n",

Comparing results with and without the allele restrictions may help resolve apparent discrepancies.\n\nNote that it not yet possible to search for specific conditions, or for penetrance, but we plan to add these features to the Advanced Search.\n\nIf, however, the allele and condition details are identical, annotation to both viable and inviable terms is probably an error (either one of the terms is wrong, or there are missing or incorrect details for the alleles and/or conditions).

The new annotations include the first contributions to come in via the new community curation system, and we thank the researchers who are participating in the initial phase of community curation.\n\nNew annotation types:\n\n-  Phenotype annotations now use the Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO), and include allele details, expression levels, and experimental conditions. With FYPO, more detailed phenotypes can be described, and links between terms for related phenotypes support improved phenotype searches.\n-  Many GO annotations now include “annotation extensions” that provide additional specificity. For example, extensions may capture the substrate of a catalytic activity, the cell cycle phase during which a function or process occurs, or any of several other types of supporting information for the annotation. Annotation extensions are described in more detail below.\n\nYou can see these new data types on many gene pages, such as cdc2 or pka1.\n\nNew web site features:\n\n-  Annotation display - Gene page GO and phenotype displays have been revamped to show new annotation types described above.\n-  Ontology term pages - Each ontology term ID now links to pages with information about the term and lists of genes annotated to it.\n-  Ontology graph links - GO and phenotype annotation sections now include links to graphical ontology displays in the genome browser.\n-  Sequence highlighting - Sequence download now offers an option to show colour highlighting of regions such as UTRs, introns and exons.\n-  Versions - Each gene page now shows the current data version in the format PomBase:x.y, where x is the Ensembl Genomes (EG) version, and y is the Chado version. The sequence, and sequence feature locations, remain stable within any EG version, whereas annotations change with each Chado update.\n-  Protein family information is now included in the Protein Features gene page section.\n-  The Protein Feature section includes a link to the Pfam entry for a protein.\n-  Transcript source data (e.g. for UTR coordinates) is now displayed in the Transcript Features section.\n-  A Documentation page contains links to relevant portions of the Ensembl Genomes documentation. (More documentation will be added over the coming months.)\n\nWhat are annotation extensions?\n\nAnnotation extensions are a form of supporting data that can be added GO annotations (or other ontology annotations) to capture additional details not provided by the ontology term itself.\n\nThe information in GO annotation extensions encompasses several effector-target relationships, such as\n\n-  localisation dependencies\n-  substrates of functions, e.g. targets of a protein kinase – see the has_substrate extensions on Cdc2’s “protein serine/threonine kinase” (GO:0004674) annotations\n-  activators and inhibitors\n-  regulation targets of signalling pathways or transcription factors\n\nAdditional extensions describe spatial and temporal aspects of processes. For example, several S. pombe annotations now include extensions that indicate in which phase of the cell cycle a gene product is found in a cellular component or involved in a process – see the pka1 annotations to “nucleus” (GO:0005634) and “cytoplasm” (GO:0005737).\n\nYou may also find the GO wiki page on annotation extensions informative, although it is primarily aimed at curators.\n\nAnnotation extensions can also be used with phenotype annotations. The most common usage of phenotype annotation extensions is to capture which gene, protein, etc. was used in an assay. For example, the sam5 (G441E) mutation of pka1 causes nuclear accumulation of Ste11. This is represented by annotation to the ontology term “nuclear protein accumulation” (FYPO:0000255), with the extension “assayed_using(PomBase:SPBC32C12.02)”. Extensions can also indicate expressivity or penetrance for a phenotype.\n",

      "content" : "\n\nPomBase now hosts transposon integration data from Lee et al. 2020. Henry Levin explains the background and significance of the work:\n\n“Transposon Integration Sequencing is a genome wide method of mapping sequences that contribute to growth. High throughput sequencing of transposon integration sites in haploid cells with single insertions reveals which genes are dispensable. Once propagated, cultures exhibit a pronounced lack of insertions in genes necessary for growth. This method, originally developed to study bacteria is now used to characterize the genomes of several yeasts including S. pombe. In earlier work we used the transposon Hermes to identify genes of S. pombe required for growth (Guo et al., 2013, Genetics, PMID:23893486). We have now applied Hermes and Transposon Integration Sequencing to identify genes important for the formation of heterochromatin (Lee et al., 2020, Cell Reports, PMID:32101745). Insertion sites from eight independent cultures can be visualized from PomBase as custom tracks on Jbrowse. Four cultures were of cells with ura4 silenced by cen1 heterochromatin. The other four cultures were\nof a strain without ura4. By passaging the cultures in 5-FOA we selected against cells with defects in heterochromatin. Genes that contributed to the formation of heterochromatin exhibited fewer insertions in cells with the cen1 copy of ura4 relative to the strain lacking ura4. To distinguish genes critical for heterochromatin from genes that contribute to a lesser extent we passaged cultures in 5-FOA for 5 generations and for 80 generations. While viewing these integration sites can indicate whether genes of interest contribute to heterochromatin formation you can also examine insertions in the cultures lacking ura4 to gage whether specific genes or noncoding sequences make significant contributions to growth.”\n",

Henry Levin explains the background and significance of the work:\n\n“Transposon Integration Sequencing is a genome wide method of mapping sequences that contribute to growth. High throughput sequencing of transposon integration sites in haploid cells with single insertions reveals which genes are dispensable. Once propagated, cultures exhibit a pronounced lack of insertions in genes necessary for growth. This method, originally developed to study bacteria is now used to characterize the genomes of several yeasts including S. pombe. In earlier work we used the transposon Hermes to identify genes of S. pombe required for growth (Guo et al., 2013, Genetics, PMID:23893486). We have now applied Hermes and Transposon Integration Sequencing to identify genes important for the formation of heterochromatin (Lee et al., 2020, Cell Reports, PMID:32101745). Insertion sites from eight independent cultures can be visualized from PomBase as custom tracks on Jbrowse. Four cultures were of cells with ura4 silenced by cen1 heterochromatin. The other four cultures were\nof a strain without ura4. By passaging the cultures in 5-FOA we selected against cells with defects in heterochromatin. Genes that contributed to the formation of heterochromatin exhibited fewer insertions in cells with the cen1 copy of ura4 relative to the strain lacking ura4. To distinguish genes critical for heterochromatin from genes that contribute to a lesser extent we passaged cultures in 5-FOA for 5 generations and for 80 generations. While viewing these integration sites can indicate whether genes of interest contribute to heterochromatin formation you can also examine insertions in the cultures lacking ura4 to gage whether specific genes or noncoding sequences make significant contributions to growth.”\n\nHermes transposon insertions in PomBase\n\n2020-09-11\n\nRead more about the new data in PomBase from Henry Levin’s lab: Lee et al. 2020 applied Hermes and Transposon Integration Sequencing to identify genes important for the formation of heterochromatin. Insertion sites from eight independent cultures can be visualized from PomBase as custom tracks on Jbrowse, and additional data are visible on the publication page and gene pages.

Each slim page provides links to ontology term pages, annotated genes, and to download files containing the slim terms and IDs.\n\nNew ontology slimming options for advanced search results\n\n2020-05-20\n\nThe PomBase advanced search results panel now allows you to retrieve annotations to any of the fission yeast GO slims or the Mondo disease slim for genes in the results list. For example, you can query for all genes involved in a process and slim the resulting list by molecular function or disease association.\n\nPomBase adopts MONDO for disease gene curation\n\n2020-05-18\n\nPomBase has switched from the Disease Ontology (DO) to the Monarch Initiative’s Mondo Disease Ontology (Mondo) for disease gene curation. Mondo covers the same set of disease descriptions as DO, but has a richer hierarchical structure that classifies more specific descriptions into broad categories (e.g. anemia, cancer, kidney disease) suitable for a disease “slim” term set.\n\nPomBase curators are collaborating with Mondo to improve its disease classification, especially in areas that will support inferences that improve fission yeast disease annotation coverage in the new PomBase Mondo slim. The new disease slim is a work in progress, so if there is a particular disease grouping that you would find useful, please let us know.\n\nImproved gene-disease curation\n\n2020-05-18\n\nPomBase disease gene curation associates disease descriptors with fission yeast orthologs of human disease-causing genes. We have now increased coverage by adding new gene–disease term connections, with 3954 individual annotations to 1195 genes (up from 2588 and 905 respectively in January 2019). Disease associations now cover 24.5% of all fission yeast protein-coding genes, and over one third of those with human orthologs.\n\nPublished: Community curation in PomBase\n\n2020-05-11\n\nThe PomBase team has published an overview of our experience with community curation for fission yeast. In the article, out this week in Database, we reflect on the factors that have made our community’s remarkable, standard-setting achievements possible, and on the benefits we and PomBase users derive from this effort.

Chromatin silencing is a phenotype resulting from the cumulative effects of these processes, and the Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO) accordingly retains a full suite of “chromatin silencing” terms.\n\nAnnotations using the GO chromatin silencing terms were reviewed, and either removed or reannotated based on what could be inferred from the phenotypes, resulting in a substantially revised set of heterochromatin assembly annotations. Further work is required, so please send us any corrections.\n\nPomBase now uses InterPro Version 79.0\n\n2020-05-05\n\nPomBase now uses InterPro Version 79.0, which integrates:\n\n-  128 new InterPro entries\n-  An update to PIRSF [3.10]\n-  151 new methods from the SUPERFAMILY (4), CATH-Gene3D (6), PIRSF (9), PANTHER (106), and CDD (26) databases.\n\nInterPro cites 48466 publications in PubMed.

The gene page Phenotype section now features a compact default display. A downloadable “viability summary” data file is now available. The PomBase BLAST server has incorporated interface changes made Ensembl-wide.\n\nNew compact GO annotation display\n\n2014-12-10\n\nTo make the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations easier to read on PomBase gene pages, we have introduced a new, streamlined display that presents just the essentials. The summary shows the term name (hyperlinked to the ontology term page), the count of genes annotated to the term, and any annotation extensions. All of the previously visible annotation details are still available – simply click the “Summary” button to switch to the “Full” view. Or click the “+” and “-” icons to expand or collapse the annotation to a single term.\n \nIn addition, the top of the Biological Process table now lists any GO slim terms applicable to the gene.\n\nesyN network visualizations in PomBase\n\n2014-12-10\n\nPomBase has implemented network visualisations for fission yeast in esyN, using data curated by BioGRID and PomBase. esyN is a web-based tool for building, sharing, and viewing network data developed by Dan Bean and Giorgio Favrin in the Cambridge Systems Biology Centre, University of Cambridge, UK.\nOn gene pages, we have links to gene-specific interaction networks in esyN in the table headers of the Interactions sections:\n\n-  The Genetic Interactions section links to all interactions centred on the gene and curated in BioGRID\n-  The Physical interactions section has links to two datasets:\n -  All physical interactions curated in BioGRID for the gene\n -  Interactions for the gene in the PomBase High Confidence Physical Interaction Network (HCPIN)\n\nWe also have esyN links on the GO Slim page and on ontology term pages for GO Slim biological process terms. Each GO Slim term links to the HCPIN physical interaction network in esyN (for example, see the “regulation of mitotic cell cycle” network).\n\nPomBase data update\n\n2014-11-12\n\nWe have updated the data available on the PomBase web site to include manual curation through October 27, 2014, including 225 community-curated publications. The gene page Phenotype section now includes data from the high-throughput microscopy analysis of viable deletion mutants reported in:\nGraml V, Studera X, Lawson JL, Chessel A, Geymonat M, Bortfeld-Miller M, Walter T, Wagstaff L, Piddini E, Carazo-Salas RE.

LaSSO, a strategy for genome-wide mapping of intronic  lariats and branch points using RNA-seq. Genome Res. 2014 Jul;24(7):1169-79. doi: 10.1101/gr.166819.113 PMID:24709818.\n\nWe have greatly improved search results for GO and FYPO annotations: both now follow more relationship types within the ontology to retrieve genes annotated to a term. The PomBase GO search now includes the regulates relationships, so its search results are consistent with those in the GO Consortium’s AmiGO browser. The FYPO search now uses has_part, has_output, and output_of as well as is_a and part_of. The Phenotype section now includes a highlighted sub-header that indicates whether a deletion mutant is viable or inviable. A file of protein complex subunits is available for download, and numerous smaller improvements have been made in the gene pages and static pages.\n\nPomBase data update\n\n2014-09-16\n\nWe have updated the data available on the PomBase web site to include manual curation through August 30, 2014.

PMID:22531001\n\nNow that more data tracks are available, we have added some categories to the track configuration section to improve organization. Additional documentation is in preparation, and will be announced here when available.\nGenome sequences for additional Schizosaccharomyces species (S. japonicus, S. octosporus, and S. cryophilus) have recently become available in Ensembl Fungi, and the PomBase genome browser now includes comparative genomics data, with a view of region comparisons between each new genome and S. pombe.\n\nHuman ortholog data correction coming next month\n\n2014-02-19\n\nWe are about to release a data update for PomBase. Please note that there is still a problem with the human orthologs, as originally described on this list in mid-December (see archived message at http://listserver.ebi.ac.uk/pipermail/pombelist/2013/003926.html). We will correct this problem in the next PomBase release, and apologise for any inconvenience in the meantime.\n\nPomBase data update\n\n2013-12-08\n\nWe have updated the data available on the PomBase web site to include manual curation through November 11, 2013. We now have future meetings available as a calendar or a list. The FAQ and some documentation pages have also been updated.\n\n2013 meeting mini-reviews published\n\n2013-11-24\n\nA series of mini-reviews, which were invited in association with the International Fission Yeast Meeting in London, have now been published in Biochemical Society Transactions: http://www.biochemsoctrans.org/bst/041/6/default.htm#c\n\n(Thanks to Jürg Bahler for this item)\n\nPomBase survey results available\n\n2013-11-20\n\nThe 2013 PomBase user survey closed at the end of October, and the results are available here (PDF at FTP site). Some highlights have been sent to the pombe mailing list. Many thanks to all who completed the survey.\n\nLink updated 2021-02-04\n\nNew “Target Of” gene page section\n\n2013-10-27\n\nWith the October 2013 update, gene pages now include “Target Of” annotations, which describe genes that affect the gene of interest. These annotations are essentially the reciprocal of ontology annotation extensions. Each “Target Of” annotation includes a relationship that indicates how the genes are connected, the name and product of the second gene, and a reference. Genes listed under “Target Of” may include upstream regulators or enzymes that modify the product of the gene of interest. For example, the “Target Of” annotations for cdc2 indicate that it is a substrate of, and regulated by, the kinase Wee1 and the phosphatase Cdc25 (among others). At present, “Target Of” data includes annotations derived from GO annotation extensions. We will soon extend it to include data from phenotype annotation extensions.\n\nPomBase data update\n\n2013-10-21\n\nThe PomBase web site has been updated and now includes manually curated data through October 6, 2013. The number of community-curated papers continues to increase, ensuring that PomBase gene pages contain complete and up-to-date information. We are also pleased to announce that data tracks are now available in the genome browser for data from these two publications:\n\n-  Woolcock KJ, Gaidatzis D, Punga T, Bühler M. 2010. Dicer associates with chromatin to repress genome activity in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2011 Jan;18(1):94-9. doi: 10.1038/nsmb.1935 PMID:21151114\n-  Mata J. 2013.

RNA Biol. 2013 Aug 1;10(8):1407-14. doi: 10.4161/rna.25758 PMID:23900342\n\nPomBase User Survey open\n\n2013-09-18\n\nTo guide current and future development, PomBase is now conducting a user survey, where we invite the fission yeast research community and any other PomBase users to evaluate the resources provided so far and comment on future priorities. The survey should take about 10 minutes to complete. Thank you for your participation!\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/s/NDM2BQX\n\nPomBase data update\n\n2013-09-15\n\nWe have once again updated the data available on the PomBase web site. The data now includes manual curation through August 11, 2013. We are particularly pleased to note that this update includes annotations from several dozen papers curated by the S. pombe community. Many thanks to all who have done, or are doing, paper curation in Canto.\nWe also have an updated version of the S. pombe/human ortholog table available upon request.\n\nSend HTP data to PomBase\n\n2013-08-18\n\nAt the pombe 2013 meeting in London, PomBase staff received numerous requests display various published data, such as gene expression, histone modifications, etc. in the genome browser. To provide this, we now invite pombe researchers to send data: If you have published any high-throughput experiments that produced data  that can be associated with genome sequence coordinates, and thereby displayed as tracks on the PomBase genome browser, please fill out the HTP Data Submission Form. We can also accept large sets of phenotype data via the Phenotype Data Submission Form. If you have any problems or questions, contact us via the PomBase Helpdesk at any time.\n\nConnecting With PomBase\n\n2013-07-29\n\nTo complement the mailing list and twitter (@PomBase) it is now possible to follow the activities of PomBase and interact with other members of the pombe community via the new LinkedIn Group and Google+.\n\nLinks to these are also available from the front page of the PomBase.org site.\n\npombelist has moved\n\n2013-07-21\n\nUpdate: This item dates from July 2013, and the links in it no longer work. \\ Please see the Fission Yeast Community page for the current mailing list link. \\ (2020-02-18)\n\nThe pombe community mailing list, pombelist, has migrated from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and is now hosted by EBI. The new address is pombelist@ebi.ac.uk (please note that the old address no longer works, and will generate an automatic notification including the new address). The link to subscribe has also been updated, and the entire archive is available at the new location.\n\nPomBase website update\n\n2013-07-18\n\nWe’d like to highlight a few improvements we’ve just made to the PomBase website. Most of the changes affect the gene pages:\n\n-  The basic information display at the top of each gene page is more compact.\n-  For ontology annotations, the number of genes annotated is now shown, in a column labeled “Count” (also, changes behind the scenes involving this data mean that pages should load faster).\n-  Annotation extensions for GO are displayed using human-friendly text instead of internal “relation” labels.\n-  The Quick Links box can now be collapsed and expanded by clicking its header.\n-  Display of modification annotations using PSI-MOD is improved.\n\nIn addition, the Motif Search output now includes standard gene names and product descriptions. As we noted in a separate message, CDS coordinate files are once again available from the Downloads, with accurate and up-to-date data.\n\nPomBase launches community curation\n\n2013-06-23\n\nAt the pombe 2013 conference in London, PomBase officially launched its community curation initiative, which allows researchers to contribute publication-based annotations directly to the database. PomBase curators invite lab heads by individual email to curate newly published papers, providing links to the online curation system and its documentation. Researchers can also initiate curation of any older fission yeast publication in PubMed. Community curation uses the open-source online tool Canto.\n\nPomBase data update\n\n2013-06-20\n\nPomBase data now includes manual curation through June 9, 2013, and represents complete annotation for 664 publications (as well as partial curation of many more). A highlight of this month’s literature curation update is the addition of over 9400 phenotype annotations, representing about 95% of the phenotype data from the recently published genome-wide study of cell cycle and cell morphology (Hayles et al. Open Biology May 2013; PMID:23697806). We have also improved the display of allele details for phenotype annotations. Other changes include better support for gene synonyms in the simple search, regular updates to the UTR data files, and a number of minor adjustments to external links in the annotation data tables and the external references section.\n\nPomBase data update\n\n2013-05-20\n\nWe have updated the data available on the PomBase web site. The data now includes manual curation through 13 May, 2013.\n\nGeneDB S. pombe decommissioned\n\n2013-05-13\n\nAs of 14 May 2013, the old GeneDB database for S. pombe is no longer available. This resource consisted of static web pages, was not updated after March 2012, and not supported by an underlying relational database. The PomBase site fully supersedes GeneDB S. pombe, and provides improved infrastructure that will meet the current and future needs of the fission yeast community. Please e-mail the helpdesk if you cannot find a replacement for any GeneDB functionality in PomBase.\n\nQuantitative gene expression data available in PomBase\n\n2013-05-07\n\nWe have extended the Gene Expression section of each gene page to support the display of quantitative expression data, and are now showing data from two publications:\n\n-  Marguerat S, Schmidt A, Codlin S, Chen W, Aebersold R, BählerJ. 2012. “Quantitative analysis of fission yeast transcriptomes and proteomes in proliferating and quiescent cells.” Cell 151:671-683.\n-  Wu JQ, Pollard TD. 2005. “Counting cytokinesis proteins globally and locally in fission yeast.” Science 310:310-314.\n\nWe will also soon refine the display of the new expression data, and can add more datasets upon request. We thank Sam Marguerat for preparing the data from both papers for inclusion in PomBase.\n\nWe have also updated the PomBase site to include manual curation through April 4, 2013, and we have updated the “all gene names” file on the PomBase ftp site. The new file is available at\nhttps://www.pombase.org/data/names_and_identifiers/gene_IDs_names.tsv\n\nLink updated 2021-02-04\n\nCarl Singer Foundation Established\n\n2013-04-11\n\nCarl Singer, who was an integral part of the yeast research community for many years, passed away on February 8, 2013. Throughout his career, Carl supported yeast research both with his engineering expertise and with his good cheer. In tribute to Carl, the Singer family has now set up The Carl Singer Foundation, a charitable foundation dedicated to supporting scientific education in the field of yeast genetics. Questions about the foundation may be directed to Harry Singer at harry [at] thecarlsingerfoundation.org.\nCarl’s family would be happy to receive memories of Carl’s life at regards [at] singerinstruments.com.\n\nH/T SGD\n\nPombe 2013: registration & abstracts by Mon 8th April\n\n2013-04-02\n\nDear Pombe Fans,\n Please remember the imminent deadline (Monday 8th April) to register and submit abstracts for Pombe 2013: http://events.embo.org/13-pombe\n Abstracts are also required from all who have already been invited to talk.\n And do book your accommodation if you haven't yet done so.\n More details are in previous email forwarded below.\n Cheers,\n -Jürg & Jacky\n From: On Behalf Of Bahler, Jurg\n Sent: 18 March 2013 17:49\n To: pombelist at sanger.ac.uk\n Subject: [Pombelist] Pombe 2013: Accommodation, registration & abstracts\n Dear Pombe Afficionados,\n Only three weeks left to register and submit abstracts for Pombe 2013, by Monday 8th April: http://events.embo.org/13-pombe\n Speakers for 10 plenary talks and all workshop talks will be selected from abstracts, and there will be attractive poster prizes.\n Payment is only requested after registration, by 10th May.\n Important: if you require accommodation, please do book this real soon now. Especially the most cost-effective student accommodation (comfortable, with private bathrooms) may not be available much longer, as it will be put on general sale shortly.

Information on accommodation is available here: http://events.embo.org/13-pombe/application.html\n We will provide a number of free registrations for which you can apply during online registration (a few of which are reserved for student members of The Genetics Society: you become eligible if you join them now). The meeting is also supported by the Biochemical Society, so if you are, or become, a member you can apply to them for student bursaries or, if you have been a member for at least 1 year, also for travel grants.\n We highly appreciate all the generous contributions from our sponsors so far:\n Platinum: EMBO\n Gold: Biochemical Society, Genetics Society, Formedium, Sunrise Science Products, Singer Instruments, F1000Research, PomBase/Wellcome Trust\n Silver: MDPI - Open Access Publishing, Hybrigenics, Infors, Life Technologies, Bioneer\n Bronze: Nature Communications, m2p labs, Imsol, Open Biology\n We look very much forward to welcoming you in London this June!\n All the best,\n -Jürg & Jacky\n\nData update on PomBase web site\n\n2013-04-01\n\nWe have once again updated the data available on the PomBase web site. The data now includes manual curation through March 6, 2013.\nWe now expect to be able to update PomBase data every month, and will soon have an automated pipeline in place. We thank all of you for your patience during the long months when updates were infrequent.\nYou should also see a few small improvements in the site:\n\n-  Ontology term pages now display the text definition for each term.\n-  FASTA sequence retrieval should be quicker, and less likely to time out, for large gene lists.\n-  There has been some tidying of the display of “extension” data for GO and phenotype annotations.\n\nLast month we noted an intermittent problem with the “Reference” column display in the data tables. The occurrence of this problem should now be greatly reduced, so please let us know if you see it recurring.\nAs usual, please don’t hesitate to alert us of any other problems with data or site performance, or if you have any questions.\n\nSpeed improvements and new data on PomBase web site\n\n2013-03-01\n\nWe have updated the data available on the PomBase web site. The data now includes manual curation through December 17, 2012, and reflects complete curation of an additional 70 papers.\nWe have also made some improvements “under the hood” that should make gene page loading much faster. Please let us know if you have any problems with gene pages loading slowly or incompletely, whether or not you have reported issues in the past.\nWe are aware that there is an intermittent problem with the “Reference” column display in the data tables – sometimes a PubMed ID appears instead of an author name and year. This problem will be fixed as soon as possible. Please alert us if you notice anything else odd or wrong.\n\nNew data and new features on PomBase web site\n\n2012-11-06\n\nWe are pleased to announce that we have updated both data and web site features for PomBase.\n\nMost importantly, we have added new data types, and upgraded the gene pages to display them.\n\nWe have also added more annotations of existing data types, bringing the web site content up to September 11, 2012. The new annotations include the first contributions to come in via the new community curation system, and we thank the researchers who are participating in the initial phase of community curation.\n\nNew annotation types:\n\n-  Phenotype annotations now use the Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO), and include allele details, expression levels, and experimental conditions. With FYPO, more detailed phenotypes can be described, and links between terms for related phenotypes support improved phenotype searches.\n-  Many GO annotations now include “annotation extensions” that provide additional specificity. For example, extensions may capture the substrate of a catalytic activity, the cell cycle phase during which a function or process occurs, or any of several other types of supporting information for the annotation. Annotation extensions are described in more detail below.\n\nYou can see these new data types on many gene pages, such as cdc2 or pka1.\n\nNew web site features:\n\n-  Annotation display - Gene page GO and phenotype displays have been revamped to show new annotation types described above.\n-  Ontology term pages - Each ontology term ID now links to pages with information about the term and lists of genes annotated to it.\n-  Ontology graph links - GO and phenotype annotation sections now include links to graphical ontology displays in the genome browser.\n-  Sequence highlighting - Sequence download now offers an option to show colour highlighting of regions such as UTRs, introns and exons.\n-  Versions - Each gene page now shows the current data version in the format PomBase:x.y, where x is the Ensembl Genomes (EG) version, and y is the Chado version. The sequence, and sequence feature locations, remain stable within any EG version, whereas annotations change with each Chado update.\n-  Protein family information is now included in the Protein Features gene page section.\n-  The Protein Feature section includes a link to the Pfam entry for a protein.\n-  Transcript source data (e.g. for UTR coordinates) is now displayed in the Transcript Features section.\n-  A Documentation page contains links to relevant portions of the Ensembl Genomes documentation. (More documentation will be added over the coming months.)\n\nWhat are annotation extensions?\n\nAnnotation extensions are a form of supporting data that can be added GO annotations (or other ontology annotations) to capture additional details not provided by the ontology term itself.\n\nThe information in GO annotation extensions encompasses several effector-target relationships, such as\n\n-  localisation dependencies\n-  substrates of functions, e.g. targets of a protein kinase – see the has_substrate extensions on Cdc2’s “protein serine/threonine kinase” (GO:0004674) annotations\n-  activators and inhibitors\n-  regulation targets of signalling pathways or transcription factors\n\nAdditional extensions describe spatial and temporal aspects of processes. For example, several S. pombe annotations now include extensions that indicate in which phase of the cell cycle a gene product is found in a cellular component or involved in a process – see the pka1 annotations to “nucleus” (GO:0005634) and “cytoplasm” (GO:0005737).\n\nYou may also find the GO wiki page on annotation extensions informative, although it is primarily aimed at curators.\n\nAnnotation extensions can also be used with phenotype annotations. The most common usage of phenotype annotation extensions is to capture which gene, protein, etc. was used in an assay. For example, the sam5 (G441E) mutation of pka1 causes nuclear accumulation of Ste11. This is represented by annotation to the ontology term “nuclear protein accumulation” (FYPO:0000255), with the extension “assayed_using(PomBase:SPBC32C12.02)”. Extensions can also indicate expressivity or penetrance for a phenotype.\n\nPomBase web site fully live\n\n2012-07-01\n\nWe are pleased to announce that the PomBase web site, www.pombase.org, is now fully live; the preview phase has ended. The site has been updated with an assortment of new features, datatypes, and bug fixes.\n\nMore recent data, reflecting additions and changes through March 20, 2012, are now available on gene pages and in search results.\n\nThe updated site features a Gene List Search that provides behavior equivalent to GeneDB’s List Download. You can now type or paste lists into the Gene Systematic IDs and Gene Names filters, and use the Query History to combine a gene list search with other search options. For convenience, there is a direct link to a search page pre-configured to accept a list of systematic IDs available in the Find menu, on the Find page, and here: http://www.pombase.org/spombe/query/builder?filter=12\n\nThe Advanced Search also now offers:\n\n-  options to search GO, FYPO, and other ontologies by term name or ID;\n-  autocomplete for ontology term name search;\n-  ability to search for genes in a region, such as centromeres or telomeres;\n-  improved organization of filter selections.\n\nWe have also fixed a Sequence Download error reported by some users, so that the “CDS”, CDS + UTRs“, and”CDS + UTRs + Introns\" options now retrieve the correct sequences.\nIn addition, numerous minor improvements have been made. Please send any questions or comments on the PomBase web site to us at <helpdesk@pombase.org>.\n\nPomBase preview launch\n\n2011-11-27\n\nA preview of PomBase, the new model organism database for the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, has been announced to the S. pombe community for testing and feedback.

Note that the silent mat2P region and cenH element are deleted in the reference strain.\n\nA contig of the h90 configuration of the mat2P-mat3M region was created by Xavier Marsellach and Lorena Aguilar (Azorín lab) using available data and S. pombe var. kambucha as a scaffold. The contig can be viewed in the genome browser. Replacing the Chromosome 2 region spanning coordinates 2129208-2137121 with the separate contig sequence yields the Chromosome 2 contig of an h90 strain.\n\nFor a description of how the mating type specific genes are organized and annotated in PomBase, see this FAQ item.\n\nFor a detailed description of the S. pombe mating type region, please see the online tutorial provided by the Nielsen lab (external link).\n",

Grewal lab), reported 2014-03-31.\n\nSequence discrepancies from the Broad Institute\n\nAs part of a technology development project, the Broad Institute generated 200-fold sequence coverage of the genome of S. pombe strain 972 using Illumina (Solexa) technology. This deep coverage was used to identify discrepancies between the Illumina read data and the current reference assembly of 972, employing a polymorphism discovery algorithm written specifically for Illumina data, and tuned to have a very low false positive call rate. 190 sequence discrepancies were observed, all but two of which were either single base insertions, deletions or substitutions. These discrepancies could be due to sequence errors in the reference 972 assembly, sequence polymorphisms between the two isolates of 972 sequenced, or systematic errors in the Illumina data or analysis. Of the 190 discrepancies, 25 occur in homopolymer runs of at least 7 nucleotides, which are both more likely to produce sequencing errors and inter-strain polymorphisms, and 39 are clustered within 10 nucleotides of another\ndiscrepancy, which is more common in cases of mis-alignment of the Illumina reads. Excluding these sites, the discrepancy rate is about 1 in 100,000, which is close to the estimated error rate in published reference sequence.\n\nThe data listed here were updated in August 2008; the original coordinates were based on an older assembly and did not match the current assembly of the right arm of Chromosome I. One discrepancy is a known artifact. At nucleotide 1774235 of Chromosome III there is an insertion of GACT caused by an assembly glitch in the published reference, which will be corrected in future releases. In addition, there are several clusters of discrepancies which are suspicious. These discrepancies will be investigated and the discrepancy list updated as appropriate. Beyond that analysis, no validation of other discrepancies is currently planned. However, we welcome any validation efforts by members of the community. If you generate any data pertinent to these discrepancies, or if you have any comments about them, please contact Nick Rhind or Valerie Wood. These data can be cited as follows: “Data were generated at the Broad Institute.

      "content" : "\n\nPurpose of Reserving Gene Names\n\nTo avoid gene naming conflicts, the S. pombeGene Naming Committee accepts reservations for gene names that will be published imminently. This does not guarantee that no one else will use your reserved gene name, but the naming committee will actively discourage alternative usage. If we become aware of a nomenclature conflict, we will attempt to notify all parties.\n\nGuidelines for naming S. pombe genes\n\n1.  The gene name should consist of three italicized lower case letters (the gene symbol) followed by an integer (e.g. rad26). This will not be italicized in the database. (Note that a few historical gene names with four letters, or without an integer, have been grandfathered into the database, but all new standard gene names must conform to the three-letters-plus-integer pattern.)\n2.  The gene name registration form will return soon. To reserve a gene name in the meantime, please email the helpdesk and include the gene systematic ID, proposed gene name, name description, the relevant PubMed ID (if available), and any other information.\n3.  The 3-letter gene symbol should stand for a description of a phenotype, gene product or gene function. In addition, we strongly prefer that a given gene symbol have only one associated description, i.e., all genes which use a given 3 letter symbol should have a related phenotype, gene product or gene function. If a 3-letter symbol is already in use, it should not be used to describe a different class of genes. Before choosing your gene name, search PomBase for any gene name beginning with the 3-letter symbol, by entering the 3-letter name followed by an asterisk, e.g. “cdc*”. Also check the usage of the 3-letter code in S. cerevisiae at SGD.\n4.  Please include your gene name(s) in the abstracts of any relevant papers. This simplifies the task of identifying yeast gene names that are already in use.\n5.  At the time of registration, the S. pombe curator will check PubMed, GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ and the Gene Name Registry to ensure the gene name is unique. If your chosen gene name is not unique, you will be contacted and asked to select a new name.\n6.  Please check that the reserved gene name is still unique, and that the gene still has no other name used for it, before submitting a publication.\n7.  If it is discovered that your gene has been previously named, your gene name would instead become an alias (synonym) for the locus, and it and any associated references will remain searchable and linked to the standard locus name.\n8.  If you reserve a gene name prior to publication, and your reserved name is published referring to a different gene before your name usage is published, a compromise specific to the situation will be made. In most cases, you will NOT retain the use of the gene name unless you published the name first (see “Resolution of gene name conflicts” below).\n9.  If no conflicts arise, your gene name will become the standard name, and will appear on the gene page and elsewhere in PomBase.\n\nResolution of gene name conflicts\n\nGene name conflicts in which multiple names have been used to describe one gene or, conversely, one name has been applied to multiple genes, will be resolved within 12 months. Whenever possible, all interested parties will be involved in the resolution of the conflict. We recognize that each case is unique, and we will choose the most appropriate solution using the following guidelines:\n\n1.  Researcher consensus: In the first instance, if the researchers involved in the name conflict agree to a resolution that satisfies our Gene Naming requirements, this solution will be implemented.\n2.  Literature consensus: In the absence of researcher consensus, we will examine the literature for the number of name usages and the number of different research groups utilizing a particular name usage. If there is a very obvious imbalance, we will favour the predominant name usage.\n3.  Priority: In the absence of either researcher or literature consensus, we will favour the gene name usage that was first published if this is significantly earlier. However, if papers are published simultaneously (within 3 months), the pre-registered name will become the primary name.\n4.  Relevance of the name: In rare cases where none of the above guidelines apply, we may favour a particular name usage that more accurately describes a phenotype, gene product or gene function.\n",
