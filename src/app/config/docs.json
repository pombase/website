Unlike traditional GO annotations, GO-CAM curation incorporates causal relationships between molecular activities and connects them to biological processes and cellular components. This approach provides a more detailed depiction of how gene products interact and function within biological systems. GO-CAMs specify entities like genes and proteins, their associated activities, and the causal links between them. These models are visualized as graphs, with nodes representing molecular activities and edges illustrating causal relationships, enabling a comprehensive understanding of interactions and pathways in biological processes.\n\nAt PomBase, we have begun representing biological pathways as GO-CAM models and displaying them on the relevant gene and process pages.\n\nFor further information see the Gene Ontology GO-CAM overview.\n\nMissing activities\n\nWe maintain a list of activities known or suspected to occur in fission yeast but not yet associated with a gene product.

We recommend using the Generic GO Term Finder at Princeton, because it offers a simple interface and up-to-date ontology and annotation data, including the current PomBase GO annotation dataset (you can upload your own background set, GO annotation file, or both). The results are provided in an tabular format. You can also use the GO Term Finder to retrieve all annotations for your gene list by setting the p-value to 1.\n\nBefore you perform an enrichment analysis, we recommend that you do a GO slim analysis of your gene list, for a broad overview of the annotation set (for more information, see the Fission Yeast GO slim documentation page and FAQ). This will enable you to focus on. the most important terms in your enrichment.\n\nYou can slim your gene lists for any GO aspect (MF, BP or CC) using the PomBase “Advanced search”:\n\n1.  Upload your list\n2.  Click on the number of results in column 1 to access the complete list\n3.  Use the “slim with” option in the menu to slim your gene set\n\nA few other enrichment tools are described on the GO Consortium’s GO Enrichment Analysis page. If you choose one of these, we recommend that you only use an enrichment tool that allows you to upload a background set representing the genes used in your experiment. Even if you regard the whole genome as the relevant background, it is important to specify the background gene set explicitly to obtain meaningful results, especially if you have data only for protein-coding genes. For example, annotated tRNA genes can obscure enrichment of protein-coding genes annotated to translation.\n\nFor any GO analysis, we strongly recommend that you describe your approach fully in methods, and include the release details (number and/or date) for PomBase and the GO terms and annotations you use.\n",

See this pombelist post for details.\n\nThese additions bring the number of proteins with human orthologs to 3641 (72%), and the number with S. cerevisiae orthologs to 4006 (79%).\n\n“Unknowns” coverage update\n\n2024-07-10\n\nIn our 2019 work, “Hidden in plain sight: What Remains to be discovered in the eukaryotic proteome?”, we demonstrated that S. pombe had a higher GO biological process (BP) annotation coverage (86.7%) than both S. cerevisiae (83.5%) and human (82.8%).\n\nOf the model eukaryotes S. pombe has:\n\n1.  The highest percentage known coverage\n2.  The fewest phylum-specific proteins\n3.  The smallest proteome (despite a higher number of genes conserved in metazoa than S. cerevisiae)\n4.  Dedicated efforts to uncover unknown functions\n\nand is uniquely positioned to be the first eukaryote for which we know the process or pathway for every protein\n\nThe trend we identified continues to hold (S. pombe “knowns” have increased to 86.9% in 2024).

This update introduces nomenclature guidelines for noncoding RNA genes, a significant update to the allele and genotype nomenclature guidelines originally published in 1987. We took several steps to improve machine readability that will benefit the artificial intelligence/machine learning communities, and our own community curation program.\n\nLera-Ramírez et al. 2023, Revised fission yeast gene and allele nomenclature guidelines for machine readability, Genetics, 2023;, iyad143\n\n[“Revised fission yeast gene and allele nomenclature guidelines for machine readability”]\n\nAccessing the list of genes from a paper\n\n2023-09-20\n\nIt’s now possible to view the list of genes associated with a paper, using a new link on the publication pages.

This feature is possible thanks to the great work of Rhea.\n\nSee the 3-deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate synthase activity (GO:0003849) term page for an example.\n\n[]\n\nCuration update - “nonsense mutation” merged into “partial amino acid deletion”\n\n2023-04-26\n\nWe have decided to merge the allele type “nonsense mutation” into “partial amino acid deletion”. This has mainly been driven by the fact that allele types that combine different variants require new types, such as “amino_acid_deletion_and_mutation”, “amino_acid_insertion_and_deletion”, etc. Otherwise, we would have ended up with many more types, and at the gene product level (which is what we describe in PomBase in phenotype interactions), both truncations are equivalent. In the next update, this allele type will not be available in Canto.\n\nIn any case, even if two alleles produce the same truncation, such as ase1-D13* or ase1Δ(13-731), they would still have separate entries in PomBase, and they may have different phenotypes. We are only assigning them the same allele type.\n\nIf for your analysis you need to make a distinction between the two using our allele dataset allele dataset, you can always check the “Allele description” field for the presence of the “*” character to tell whether an allele includes a nonsense mutation.\n\nExperimental structures from PDB on gene pages\n\n2023-02-22\n\nThe experimental protein structures from PDB are now embedded on the PomBase gene pages using Mol*. For example: lsm7/SPCC285.12 gene page\n\nIf you select the “PDB structures” view on a gene page, experimental structures will set as your default. AlphaFold predictions will be shown for genes where an experimental structure are not available.\n\nWe now also display the structures on the associated publication page. For example: PMID:31010807 Garg et al.\n\nTo help locate proteins with experimental protein structures (currently 375), we have added a new query option to the “Advanced search”, currently under “commonly used queries”: “Proteins with PDB structures”\n\n[PDB structures on the lsm7 gene page]\n\nAlphaFold protein structure on gene pages\n\n2023-02-02\n\nAlphaFold protein structure are now embedded on the PomBase gene pages. We hope to embed the experimental structures from PDB in the near future.\n\n[Example from the mvp1 gene page]\n\nRevised canonical 5’ UTRs\n\n2023-01-24\n\nWe have revised the curated 5’UTRs using Transcription Start Sites (TSS) data (in vegetative growth/ minimal media) from the Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) data provided by Thodberg et al. All new gene structures were manually reviewed, around ~80 protein features had N-terminal coordinate revisions to align with TSS data.\n\nGlobal Core Biodata Resource status for PomBase\n\n2022-12-15\n\nWe are very pleased to announce that PomBase has been selected as one of the first Global Core Biodata Resource (GCBR) — a collection of 37 resources whose long term funding and sustainability is critical to life science and biomedical research worldwide. This accreditation recognizes PomBase as a primary knowledge base (adding value to data through expert curation) and as a crucial component of the research ecosystem. The candidate biodata resources were assessed against a series of rigorous criteria that included their scientific focus, the size and reach of their user communities, their quality of service, their governance, and their impact on global research.\n\nThank you to the entire community, especially the community curators who contribute regularly to our content, and our Scientific Advisory Board for their help and support.\n\nFor more information about the Global Biodata Coalition and PomBase’s new status, see the full press release.\n\nNext PombeTalks: Wednesday, December 14th\n\n2022-12-08\n\nThe next online PombeTalks will take place on Wednesday, December 14th.

For example, if a strain with genotype asp1-H397A has the phenotype decreased acid phosphatase activity affecting activity of pho1, but this phenotype is suppressed when rhn1 is deleted in that strain, we would annotate that the genes asp1 and rhn1 are part of a Phenotypic Suppression interaction.\n\n[GI old format]\n\nWe continue to display interactions in this format by default (showing only genes and interaction type), but if you expand the annotation, you can view the associated genotypes and phenotypes.\n\n[GI new format]\n\nIn the revised Canto interface, you can only annotate a genetic interaction from the double mutant phenotype annotation (by clicking on add.., as shown below).\n\n[GI annotation in Canto]\n\nOf course, genetic interactions predating this update are not linked to phenotypes or genotypes, but we are hoping to auto-annotate several of those. We will also prioritise for update any interactions where community curators have provided these details in an annotation comment. Finally, a big shoutout to Ana Sanchez and Angad Garg from the Shuman lab, for testing the new interface in numerous recently curated publications. The examples provided here are from Sanchez et al. 2019.

The Reciprocal Best Structure Hits (RBSH) approach provided 11 novel human homologues, including Pho86 -> NAT8 (ER acetyltransferase), Mug174 -> COIL (Coilin), Ach1 -> OXCT1 (succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid coenzyme A transferase), SPAC1952.08c -> CREG1, imt1 -> A4GALT (Lactosylceramide 4-alpha-galactosyltransferase), Rtc5 -> MEAK7 (MTOR associated protein). A further 41 novel orthologs were predicted between S. pombe and S. cerevisiae which had fallen under the radar for all other methods used at PomBase. Most of the novel connections provided additional functional information, or supported existing knowledge for poorly characterised proteins. See supporting data tables S4 and S5 for the complete list of predictions included in PomBase.

Henry Levin explains the background and significance of the work:\n\n“Transposon Integration Sequencing is a genome wide method of mapping sequences that contribute to growth. High throughput sequencing of transposon integration sites in haploid cells with single insertions reveals which genes are dispensable. Once propagated, cultures exhibit a pronounced lack of insertions in genes necessary for growth. This method, originally developed to study bacteria is now used to characterize the genomes of several yeasts including S. pombe. In earlier work we used the transposon Hermes to identify genes of S. pombe required for growth (Guo et al., 2013, Genetics, PMID:23893486). We have now applied Hermes and Transposon Integration Sequencing to identify genes important for the formation of heterochromatin (Lee et al., 2020, Cell Reports, PMID:32101745). Insertion sites from eight independent cultures can be visualized from PomBase as custom tracks on Jbrowse. Four cultures were of cells with ura4 silenced by cen1 heterochromatin. The other four cultures were\nof a strain without ura4. By passaging the cultures in 5-FOA we selected against cells with defects in heterochromatin. Genes that contributed to the formation of heterochromatin exhibited fewer insertions in cells with the cen1 copy of ura4 relative to the strain lacking ura4. To distinguish genes critical for heterochromatin from genes that contribute to a lesser extent we passaged cultures in 5-FOA for 5 generations and for 80 generations. While viewing these integration sites can indicate whether genes of interest contribute to heterochromatin formation you can also examine insertions in the cultures lacking ura4 to gage whether specific genes or noncoding sequences make significant contributions to growth.”\n\nNew genome browser datasets 2020-09-08\n\n2020-09-08\n\nThree new datasets in are now available in PomBase JBrowse (links go to PomBase publication pages, which in turn link to the browser with the tracks enabled):\n\n-  Transcription start sites from\n Li H, Hou J, Bai L, Hu C, Tong P, Kang Y, Zhao X, Shao Z. 2015.\n Genome-wide analysis of core promoter structures in Schizosaccharomyces pombe with DeepCAGE.\n PMID:25747261 DOI:10.1080/15476286.2015.1022704\n\n-  Transcript data from\n Eser P, Wachutka L, Maier KC, Demel C, Boroni M, Iyer S, Cramer P, Gagneur J. 2016\n Determinants of RNA metabolism in the Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome.\n PMID:26883383 DOI:10.15252/msb.20156526\n\n-  Transposon insertion sites from\n Lee SY, Hung S, Esnault C, Pathak R, Johnson KR, Bankole O, Yamashita A, Zhang H Levin HL.\n Dense Transposon Integration Reveals Essential Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors Promote Heterochromatin Formation.\n PMID:32101745 DOI:10.1016/j.celrep.2020.01.094\n\nSubmit your genome browser data\n\n2020-09-08\n\nWe have updated our HTP data submission procedure to make it easier for you to contribute your datasets for PomBase JBrowse:\n\nWe now provide spreadsheet templates in Excel and Open Document formats that gather the metadata we need to load and display your data.

Each slim page provides links to ontology term pages, annotated genes, and to download files containing the slim terms and IDs.\n\nNew ontology slimming options for advanced search results\n\n2020-05-20\n\nThe PomBase advanced search results panel now allows you to retrieve annotations to any of the fission yeast GO slims or the Mondo disease slim for genes in the results list. For example, you can query for all genes involved in a process and slim the resulting list by molecular function or disease association.\n\nPomBase adopts MONDO for disease gene curation\n\n2020-05-18\n\nPomBase has switched from the Disease Ontology (DO) to the Monarch Initiative’s Mondo Disease Ontology (Mondo) for disease gene curation. Mondo covers the same set of disease descriptions as DO, but has a richer hierarchical structure that classifies more specific descriptions into broad categories (e.g. anemia, cancer, kidney disease) suitable for a disease “slim” term set.\n\nPomBase curators are collaborating with Mondo to improve its disease classification, especially in areas that will support inferences that improve fission yeast disease annotation coverage in the new PomBase Mondo slim. The new disease slim is a work in progress, so if there is a particular disease grouping that you would find useful, please let us know.\n\nImproved gene-disease curation\n\n2020-05-18\n\nPomBase disease gene curation associates disease descriptors with fission yeast orthologs of human disease-causing genes. We have now increased coverage by adding new gene–disease term connections, with 3954 individual annotations to 1195 genes (up from 2588 and 905 respectively in January 2019). Disease associations now cover 24.5% of all fission yeast protein-coding genes, and over one third of those with human orthologs.\n\nPublished: Community curation in PomBase\n\n2020-05-11\n\nThe PomBase team has published an overview of our experience with community curation for fission yeast. In the article, out this week in Database, we reflect on the factors that have made our community’s remarkable, standard-setting achievements possible, and on the benefits we and PomBase users derive from this effort. We highlight the collaboration between authors and professional curators that arises via community curation, and how annotation quality improves as a result.\n\nWatch for invitations to curate your new papers, or see our community curation page for more information.\n\nPombeTalks May 13th\n\n2020-05-07\n\nThe next online PombeTalks will take place on Wednesday 13 May 2020 at 17:00 Central European Time.

Chromatin silencing is a phenotype resulting from the cumulative effects of these processes, and the Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO) accordingly retains a full suite of “chromatin silencing” terms.\n\nAnnotations using the GO chromatin silencing terms were reviewed, and either removed or reannotated based on what could be inferred from the phenotypes, resulting in a substantially revised set of heterochromatin assembly annotations. Further work is required, so please send us any corrections.\n\nPomBase now uses InterPro Version 79.0\n\n2020-05-05\n\nPomBase now uses InterPro Version 79.0, which integrates:\n\n-  128 new InterPro entries\n-  An update to PIRSF [3.10]\n-  151 new methods from the SUPERFAMILY (4), CATH-Gene3D (6), PIRSF (9), PANTHER (106), and CDD (26) databases.\n\nInterPro cites 48466 publications in PubMed.

Additional documentation is in preparation, and will be announced here when available.\nGenome sequences for additional Schizosaccharomyces species (S. japonicus, S. octosporus, and S. cryophilus) have recently become available in Ensembl Fungi, and the PomBase genome browser now includes comparative genomics data, with a view of region comparisons between each new genome and S. pombe.\n\nHuman ortholog data correction coming next month\n\n2014-02-19\n\nWe are about to release a data update for PomBase. Please note that there is still a problem with the human orthologs, as originally described on this list in mid-December (see archived message at http://listserver.ebi.ac.uk/pipermail/pombelist/2013/003926.html). We will correct this problem in the next PomBase release, and apologise for any inconvenience in the meantime.\n\nPomBase data update 2013-12-08\n\n2013-12-08\n\nWe have updated the data available on the PomBase web site to include manual curation through November 11, 2013. We now have future meetings available as a calendar or a list. The FAQ and some documentation pages have also been updated.\n\n2021-08-18: Updated to remove out-of-date links (events are now listed only as news items).\n\n2013 meeting mini-reviews published\n\n2013-11-24\n\nA series of mini-reviews, which were invited in association with the International Fission Yeast Meeting in London, have now been published in Biochemical Society Transactions: http://www.biochemsoctrans.org/bst/041/6/default.htm#c\n\n(Thanks to Jürg Bahler for this item)\n\nPomBase survey results available\n\n2013-11-20\n\nThe 2013 PomBase user survey closed at the end of October, and the results are available here (PDF at FTP site). Some highlights have been sent to the pombe mailing list. Many thanks to all who completed the survey.\n\nLink updated 2021-02-04\n\nNew “Target Of” gene page section\n\n2013-10-27\n\nWith the October 2013 update, gene pages now include “Target Of” annotations, which describe genes that affect the gene of interest. These annotations are essentially the reciprocal of ontology annotation extensions. Each “Target Of” annotation includes a relationship that indicates how the genes are connected, the name and product of the second gene, and a reference. Genes listed under “Target Of” may include upstream regulators or enzymes that modify the product of the gene of interest. For example, the “Target Of” annotations for cdc2 indicate that it is a substrate of, and regulated by, the kinase Wee1 and the phosphatase Cdc25 (among others). At present, “Target Of” data includes annotations derived from GO annotation extensions. We will soon extend it to include data from phenotype annotation extensions.\n\nPomBase data update 2013-10-21\n\n2013-10-21\n\nThe PomBase web site has been updated and now includes manually curated data through October 6, 2013. The number of community-curated papers continues to increase, ensuring that PomBase gene pages contain complete and up-to-date information. We are also pleased to announce that data tracks are now available in the genome browser for data from these two publications:\n\n-  Woolcock KJ, Gaidatzis D, Punga T, Bühler M. 2010. Dicer associates with chromatin to repress genome activity in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2011 Jan;18(1):94-9. doi: 10.1038/nsmb.1935 PMID:21151114\n-  Mata J. 2013. Genome-wide mapping of polyadenylation sites in fission yeast reveals widespread alternative polyadenylation. RNA Biol. 2013 Aug 1;10(8):1407-14. doi: 10.4161/rna.25758 PMID:23900342\n\nPomBase User Survey open\n\n2013-09-18\n\nTo guide current and future development, PomBase is now conducting a user survey, where we invite the fission yeast research community and any other PomBase users to evaluate the resources provided so far and comment on future priorities. The survey should take about 10 minutes to complete. Thank you for your participation!\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/s/NDM2BQX\n\nPomBase data update 2013-09-15\n\n2013-09-15\n\nWe have once again updated the data available on the PomBase web site. The data now includes manual curation through August 11, 2013. We are particularly pleased to note that this update includes annotations from several dozen papers curated by the S. pombe community. Many thanks to all who have done, or are doing, paper curation in Canto.\nWe also have an updated version of the S. pombe/human ortholog table available upon request.\n\nSend HTP data to PomBase\n\n2013-08-18\n\nAt the pombe 2013 meeting in London, PomBase staff received numerous requests display various published data, such as gene expression, histone modifications, etc. in the genome browser. To provide this, we now invite pombe researchers to send data: If you have published any high-throughput experiments that produced data  that can be associated with genome sequence coordinates, and thereby displayed as tracks on the PomBase genome browser, please fill out the HTP Data Submission Form. We can also accept large sets of phenotype data via the Phenotype Data Submission Form. If you have any problems or questions, contact us via the PomBase Helpdesk at any time.\n\nConnecting With PomBase\n\n2013-07-29\n\nTo complement the mailing list and twitter (}PomBase) it is now possible to follow the activities of PomBase and interact with other members of the pombe community via the new LinkedIn Group and Google+.\n\nLinks to these are also available from the front page of the PomBase.org site.\n\npombelist has moved\n\n2013-07-21\n\nUpdate: This item dates from July 2013, and the links in it no longer work. \\ Please see the Fission Yeast Community page for the current mailing list link. \\ (2020-02-18)\n\nThe pombe community mailing list, pombelist, has migrated from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and is now hosted by EBI. The new address is <pombelist}ebi.ac.uk> (please note that the old address no longer works, and will generate an automatic notification including the new address). The link to subscribe has also been updated, and the entire archive is available at the new location.\n\nPomBase website update\n\n2013-07-18\n\nWe’d like to highlight a few improvements we’ve just made to the PomBase website. Most of the changes affect the gene pages:\n\n-  The basic information display at the top of each gene page is more compact.\n-  For ontology annotations, the number of genes annotated is now shown, in a column labeled “Count” (also, changes behind the scenes involving this data mean that pages should load faster).\n-  Annotation extensions for GO are displayed using human-friendly text instead of internal “relation” labels.\n-  The Quick Links box can now be collapsed and expanded by clicking its header.\n-  Display of modification annotations using PSI-MOD is improved.\n\nIn addition, the Motif Search output now includes standard gene names and product descriptions. As we noted in a separate message, CDS coordinate files are once again available from the Downloads, with accurate and up-to-date data.\n\nPomBase launches community curation\n\n2013-06-23\n\nAt the pombe 2013 conference in London, PomBase officially launched its community curation initiative, which allows researchers to contribute publication-based annotations directly to the database. PomBase curators invite lab heads by individual email to curate newly published papers, providing links to the online curation system and its documentation. Researchers can also initiate curation of any older fission yeast publication in PubMed. Community curation uses the open-source online tool Canto.\n\nPomBase data update 2013-06-20\n\n2013-06-20\n\nPomBase data now includes manual curation through June 9, 2013, and represents complete annotation for 664 publications (as well as partial curation of many more). A highlight of this month’s literature curation update is the addition of over 9400 phenotype annotations, representing about 95% of the phenotype data from the recently published genome-wide study of cell cycle and cell morphology (Hayles et al. Open Biology May 2013; PMID:23697806). We have also improved the display of allele details for phenotype annotations. Other changes include better support for gene synonyms in the simple search, regular updates to the UTR data files, and a number of minor adjustments to external links in the annotation data tables and the external references section.\n\nPomBase data update\n\n2013-05-20\n\nWe have updated the data available on the PomBase web site. The data now includes manual curation through 13 May, 2013.\n\nGeneDB S. pombe decommissioned\n\n2013-05-13\n\nAs of 14 May 2013, the old GeneDB database for S. pombe is no longer available. This resource consisted of static web pages, was not updated after March 2012, and not supported by an underlying relational database. The PomBase site fully supersedes GeneDB S. pombe, and provides improved infrastructure that will meet the current and future needs of the fission yeast community. Please e-mail the helpdesk if you cannot find a replacement for any GeneDB functionality in PomBase.\n\nQuantitative gene expression data available in PomBase\n\n2013-05-07\n\nWe have extended the Gene Expression section of each gene page to support the display of quantitative expression data, and are now showing data from two publications:\n\n-  Marguerat S, Schmidt A, Codlin S, Chen W, Aebersold R, BählerJ. 2012. “Quantitative analysis of fission yeast transcriptomes and proteomes in proliferating and quiescent cells.” Cell 151:671-683.\n-  Wu JQ, Pollard TD. 2005. “Counting cytokinesis proteins globally and locally in fission yeast.” Science 310:310-314.\n\nWe will also soon refine the display of the new expression data, and can add more datasets upon request. We thank Sam Marguerat for preparing the data from both papers for inclusion in PomBase.\n\nWe have also updated the PomBase site to include manual curation through April 4, 2013, and we have updated the “all gene names” file on the PomBase ftp site.

Throughout his career, Carl supported yeast research both with his engineering expertise and with his good cheer. In tribute to Carl, the Singer family has now set up The Carl Singer Foundation, a charitable foundation dedicated to supporting scientific education in the field of yeast genetics. Questions about the foundation may be directed to Harry Singer at harry [at] thecarlsingerfoundation.org.\nCarl’s family would be happy to receive memories of Carl’s life at regards [at] singerinstruments.com.\n\nH/T SGD\n\nPombe 2013: registration & abstracts by Mon 8th April\n\n2013-04-02\n\nDear Pombe Fans,\n Please remember the imminent deadline (Monday 8th April) to register and submit abstracts for Pombe 2013: http://events.embo.org/13-pombe\n Abstracts are also required from all who have already been invited to talk.\n And do book your accommodation if you haven't yet done so.\n More details are in previous email forwarded below.\n Cheers,\n -Jürg & Jacky\n From: On Behalf Of Bahler, Jurg\n Sent: 18 March 2013 17:49\n To: pombelist at sanger.ac.uk\n Subject: [Pombelist] Pombe 2013: Accommodation, registration & abstracts\n Dear Pombe Afficionados,\n Only three weeks left to register and submit abstracts for Pombe 2013, by Monday 8th April: http://events.embo.org/13-pombe\n Speakers for 10 plenary talks and all workshop talks will be selected from abstracts, and there will be attractive poster prizes.\n Payment is only requested after registration, by 10th May.\n Important: if you require accommodation, please do book this real soon now. Especially the most cost-effective student accommodation (comfortable, with private bathrooms) may not be available much longer, as it will be put on general sale shortly. Both hotels and student accommodation will sell out in June, so you have to arrange it now. Information on accommodation is available here: http://events.embo.org/13-pombe/application.html\n We will provide a number of free registrations for which you can apply during online registration (a few of which are reserved for student members of The Genetics Society: you become eligible if you join them now). The meeting is also supported by the Biochemical Society, so if you are, or become, a member you can apply to them for student bursaries or, if you have been a member for at least 1 year, also for travel grants.\n We highly appreciate all the generous contributions from our sponsors so far:\n Platinum: EMBO\n Gold: Biochemical Society, Genetics Society, Formedium, Sunrise Science Products, Singer Instruments, F1000Research, PomBase/Wellcome Trust\n Silver: MDPI - Open Access Publishing, Hybrigenics, Infors, Life Technologies, Bioneer\n Bronze: Nature Communications, m2p labs, Imsol, Open Biology\n We look very much forward to welcoming you in London this June!\n All the best,\n -Jürg & Jacky\n\nData update on PomBase web site\n\n2013-04-01\n\nWe have once again updated the data available on the PomBase web site. The data now includes manual curation through March 6, 2013.\nWe now expect to be able to update PomBase data every month, and will soon have an automated pipeline in place. We thank all of you for your patience during the long months when updates were infrequent.\nYou should also see a few small improvements in the site:\n\n-  Ontology term pages now display the text definition for each term.\n-  FASTA sequence retrieval should be quicker, and less likely to time out, for large gene lists.\n-  There has been some tidying of the display of “extension” data for GO and phenotype annotations.\n\nLast month we noted an intermittent problem with the “Reference” column display in the data tables. The occurrence of this problem should now be greatly reduced, so please let us know if you see it recurring.\nAs usual, please don’t hesitate to alert us of any other problems with data or site performance, or if you have any questions.\n\nSpeed improvements and new data on PomBase web site\n\n2013-03-01\n\nWe have updated the data available on the PomBase web site. The data now includes manual curation through December 17, 2012, and reflects complete curation of an additional 70 papers.\nWe have also made some improvements “under the hood” that should make gene page loading much faster. Please let us know if you have any problems with gene pages loading slowly or incompletely, whether or not you have reported issues in the past.\nWe are aware that there is an intermittent problem with the “Reference” column display in the data tables – sometimes a PubMed ID appears instead of an author name and year. This problem will be fixed as soon as possible. Please alert us if you notice anything else odd or wrong.\n\nNew data and new features on PomBase web site\n\n2012-11-06\n\nWe are pleased to announce that we have updated both data and web site features for PomBase.\n\nMost importantly, we have added new data types, and upgraded the gene pages to display them.\n\nWe have also added more annotations of existing data types, bringing the web site content up to September 11, 2012. The new annotations include the first contributions to come in via the new community curation system, and we thank the researchers who are participating in the initial phase of community curation.\n\nNew annotation types:\n\n-  Phenotype annotations now use the Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO), and include allele details, expression levels, and experimental conditions. With FYPO, more detailed phenotypes can be described, and links between terms for related phenotypes support improved phenotype searches.\n-  Many GO annotations now include “annotation extensions” that provide additional specificity. For example, extensions may capture the substrate of a catalytic activity, the cell cycle phase during which a function or process occurs, or any of several other types of supporting information for the annotation. Annotation extensions are described in more detail below.\n\nYou can see these new data types on many gene pages, such as cdc2 or pka1.\n\nNew web site features:\n\n-  Annotation display - Gene page GO and phenotype displays have been revamped to show new annotation types described above.\n-  Ontology term pages - Each ontology term ID now links to pages with information about the term and lists of genes annotated to it.\n-  Ontology graph links - GO and phenotype annotation sections now include links to graphical ontology displays in the genome browser.\n-  Sequence highlighting - Sequence download now offers an option to show colour highlighting of regions such as UTRs, introns and exons.\n-  Versions - Each gene page now shows the current data version in the format PomBase:x.y, where x is the Ensembl Genomes (EG) version, and y is the Chado version. The sequence, and sequence feature locations, remain stable within any EG version, whereas annotations change with each Chado update.\n-  Protein family information is now included in the Protein Features gene page section.\n-  The Protein Feature section includes a link to the Pfam entry for a protein.\n-  Transcript source data (e.g. for UTR coordinates) is now displayed in the Transcript Features section.\n-  A Documentation page contains links to relevant portions of the Ensembl Genomes documentation. (More documentation will be added over the coming months.)\n\nWhat are annotation extensions?\n\nAnnotation extensions are a form of supporting data that can be added GO annotations (or other ontology annotations) to capture additional details not provided by the ontology term itself.\n\nThe information in GO annotation extensions encompasses several effector-target relationships, such as\n\n-  localisation dependencies\n-  substrates of functions, e.g. targets of a protein kinase – see the has_substrate extensions on Cdc2’s “protein serine/threonine kinase” (GO:0004674) annotations\n-  activators and inhibitors\n-  regulation targets of signalling pathways or transcription factors\n\nAdditional extensions describe spatial and temporal aspects of processes. For example, several S. pombe annotations now include extensions that indicate in which phase of the cell cycle a gene product is found in a cellular component or involved in a process – see the pka1 annotations to “nucleus” (GO:0005634) and “cytoplasm” (GO:0005737).\n\nYou may also find the GO wiki page on annotation extensions informative, although it is primarily aimed at curators.\n\nAnnotation extensions can also be used with phenotype annotations. The most common usage of phenotype annotation extensions is to capture which gene, protein, etc. was used in an assay. For example, the sam5 (G441E) mutation of pka1 causes nuclear accumulation of Ste11. This is represented by annotation to the ontology term “nuclear protein accumulation” (FYPO:0000255), with the extension “assayed_using(PomBase:SPBC32C12.02)”. Extensions can also indicate expressivity or penetrance for a phenotype.\n\nPomBase web site fully live\n\n2012-07-01\n\nNote (2023-06-09): This is an archived news item about PomBase V1. See the documentation page to learn new Advanced search in PomBase V2.\n\nWe are pleased to announce that the PomBase web site, www.pombase.org, is now fully live; the preview phase has ended. The site has been updated with an assortment of new features, datatypes, and bug fixes.\n\nMore recent data, reflecting additions and changes through March 20, 2012, are now available on gene pages and in search results.\n\nThe updated site features a Gene List Search that provides behavior equivalent to GeneDB’s List Download. You can now type or paste lists into the Gene Systematic IDs and Gene Names filters, and use the Query History to combine a gene list search with other search options. For convenience, there is a direct link to a search page pre-configured to accept a list of systematic IDs available in the Find menu, on the Find page, and here: http://www.pombase.org/spombe/query/builder?filter=12\n\nThe Advanced Search also now offers:\n\n-  options to search GO, FYPO, and other ontologies by term name or ID;\n-  autocomplete for ontology term name search;\n-  ability to search for genes in a region, such as centromeres or telomeres;\n-  improved organization of filter selections.\n\nWe have also fixed a Sequence Download error reported by some users, so that the “CDS”, CDS + UTRs”, and “CDS + UTRs + Introns” options now retrieve the correct sequences.\nIn addition, numerous minor improvements have been made. Please send any questions or comments on the PomBase web site to us at <<helpdesk}pombase.org>>.\n\nPomBase preview launch\n\n2011-11-27\n\nA preview of PomBase, the new model organism database for the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, has been announced to the S. pombe community for testing and feedback.

To monitor this issue, PomBase maintains an inventory of unknown proteins, originally described in Wood et al. 2019.\n\nWe regularly review genes in the “unknown” category to determine whether new functional data are available from other species. A gene is classified as unknown when no broad biological role can be inferred from experimental data in S. pombe or from an experimentally characterised ortholog in any other organism. Importantly, we require robust supporting evidence to assign a GO biological process annotation. Finally, because every S. pombe gene has been reviewed for GO biological process, these genes are “known unknowns” rather than “unannotated”.\n\nKnown/unknown protein status tracker\n\n``\n\nUnknown protein-related lists\n\nNote: You can also retrieve current lists of genes with each characterisation status using the advanced search.
