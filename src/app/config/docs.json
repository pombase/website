      "content" : "\n\n-  Monarch is a platform that connects phenotypes to environmental factors and genotypes, integrating phenotypes from multiple species to make them queryable in a single portal, and use the combined knowledge to better understand human disease. We have worked with them to integrate our phenotype data into Monarch.\n\n-  Mondo is a disease ontology developed as part of the Monarch initiative. It aims to merge multiple disease ontologies and develop guidelines for disease logical definitions, which are computer-readable. We actively contribute to the development of this ontology, and link fission yeast genes with Mondo terms.\n\n-  uPheno is another component of the Monarch Initiative with the goal of integrating multiple phenotype ontologies into a unified cross-species phenotype ontology to make them interoperable. This interoperability is achieved by developing templates for phenotype logical definitions. We interact with uPheno developers to develop and implement standardised definition templates into FYPO.\n\n-  Chris Mungall is head of the Biosystems Data Science, Lawrence Berkeley Lab. We work with Chris and his team on multiple AI-related projects related to ontologies and biocuration.\n\n-  Pfam and InterPro are protein family databases. We have been collaborating with the Pfam and InterPro teams at the EBI for almost two decades, submitting over 1000 protein families via Pfam and providing QC for InterPro to GO mapping assignments. Recently, to increase ortholog coverage, we collaborated with the Pfam team to identify distant orthologs using AlphaFold reciprocal best structure hits. See this Bioinformatics Advances publication.\n\n-  The Gene Ontology Consortium oversees the development of GO, to standardise the functional description of gene products. PomBase is a member of the GO consortium. PomBase Co-PI and project manager Valerie Wood is a member of the GO council, and funded to work on GO development as PI of a GO subcontract. Our curators actively contribute to GO development requesting changes and additions to the ontology. We also participate in other GO-related projects, for example:\n\n-  The Term Matrix annotation QC project, a framework to develop rules to identify potentially incorrect GO annotations by identifying genes annotated to two biological processes unlikely to be co-annotated to the same gene products.\n -  Revision of the Gene Ontology terms of chromatin-related processes to improve the GO representation of chromatin and epigenetics curation, since fission yeast is a major model species for this research field.\n\n-  PHI-base is a pathogen-host interaction database. PomBase supports PHI-base by adapting Canto (our community curation tool) for their curation and advising on phenotype ontology and literature curation.\n\n-  FlyBase is a model organism for Drosophila. PomBase supports FlyBase by adapting Canto (our community curation tool) for their complex phenotype annotation.\n\n-  RNAcentral is a non-coding RNA sequence database. As part of our data dissemination obligations, along with other model organism databases, we provide curated non-coding RNAs to RNA Central.\n\n-  BioGRID is a database for genetic and physical interactions. They curate interactions from publications that are integrated into PomBase, and vice-versa, to avoid duplication of curation effort.\n\n-  microPublication is a peer-reviewed journal that publishes one-figure papers with novel findings, negative or reproduced results, and results that may lack a broader scientific narrative. We are a partner database and provide curator input and promote articles on our website. This novel format incentivises reporting small and negative results, preventing research duplication and waste of research funding.\n\n-  JaponicusDB is the model organism database for the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces japonicus, an emerging model organism. JaponicusDB uses PomBase’s website code and its curation is entirely provided by the authors using Canto. This database was set up in a sprint of less than three months, and is a success story that shows that PomBase code and curation tools are reusable. Read more.\n\n-  Valerie de Crecy-Lagard recently organised a workshop funded by NSF to devise a roadmap for the functional annotation of protein families. The meeting report is now published in Database.\n\n-  Genestorian is a project that aims to develop: (1) Open standards to document the generation of plasmids and strains in a machine-readable format, with an emphasis on interoperability, adhering to FAIR principles. (2) Easy to use web tools for experimental researchers to document strain and plasmid generation in their collections by leveraging those open standards.\n\n-  APICURON collects and aggregates biocuration events from third party resources and generates achievements and leaderboards. We are a partner resource of APICURON to credit and acknowledge the work of PomBase biocurators.\n\n-  The Complex Portal is a manually curated, encyclopaedic resource of macromolecular complexes from a number of key model organisms. We are actively working with Sandra Orchard at the Compex Portal to curate the fission yeast complex compendium.\n\n-  Europe PMC: We are working with ePMC to provide training data and biocurator input for automated data extraction.\n\n-  HGNC is the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee. We provide the HGNC with manually curated orthologs between fission yeast and humans (many distant orthologs not recorded elsewhere). We also informally collaborate with the HGNC on nomenclature standards and unified nomenclature.\n\n-  The Bähler laboratory studies cellular quiescence, ageing and gene function using fission yeast and turquoise killifish as model systems. We collaborate with Jurg Bähler’s group to advise on aspects of interrogating the “UNKNOWNome” as part of their OFFBEAT project.\n\n-  Andrew Green (Arise Fellow, EMBL-EBI) is testing PomBase curated datasets for i) literature classification and ii) gene summarisation.\n",

      "content" : "\n\nPomBase defines a phenotype as an observable characteristic, or set of characteristics, of an organism that results from the interaction of its genotype with a given environment. In PomBase, phenotypes are annotated using terms from the Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO). FYPO uses several existing ontologies from the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) collection to construct formal definitions. Basic documentation for FYPO is available at the OBO Foundry, and further information is available on the FYPO wiki).\n\nIn the phenotype annotation display on PomBase gene pages, the first item shown is a brief summary indicating whether cells with a null (deletion) allele of the gene are viable or inviable, or either depending on experimental conditions. Next, single-locus phenotypes are shown in two tables. The first table lists phenotypes observed at the population level, such as viability in culture, and the second shows cell-level phenotypes. Note that the viable/inviable population terms describe whether a gene is essential or not, and see the wiki FYPO Content and Structure documentation for more information on cell and population phenotypes. Finally, two more tables list population-level and cell-level multi-locus phenotypes, i.e. phenotypes associated with double mutants, triple mutants, etc, and the relevant genotype details. Diploid genotypes are included in the single- or multi-locus tables as appropriate.\n\nEach table includes ontology term details and supporting data. The summary view shows just the essentials: The list of terms is filtered, using the ontology structure, so that it shows only the most specific terms used to annotate a genotype, and each unique combination of gene, FYPO term, allele(s) and extension(s) is shown once. For single-allele phenotypes, the display includes:\n\n[single-locus FYPO summary on gene page]\n\n1.  The FYPO term name, which links to a page with additional information, including the term definition, any synonyms, relationships to other FYPO terms, and annotations to the term or its descendants. (See the ontology term page documentation for more.)\n2.  Allele details, including a symbol (if one is used in the literature) and description (where known). Diploid genotypes specify both alleles for the locus, and are shown in bold. Mouse over the allele symbol to show the allele type, which indicates whether partial deletions or altered residues refer to amino acids or nucleotides, and expression level. If you can provide a description for any allele shown as “unknown”, please contact the PomBase curators.\n3.  Phenotype annotations may have extensions to capture penetrance (proportion of a population that shows the phenotype) or severity (previously designated “expressivity”), or to document which gene or protein used in an assay for level, localisation, etc. S. pombe genes link to PomBase gene pages. Severity and penetrance use the relations has_severity and has_penetrance respectively, and can have values such as “high”, “medium”, or “low”. Penetrance can also use numerical values. A gene or gene product used in an assay is stored using the appropriate PomBase systematic ID and the relation assayed_using; the relation is converted to affecting in the gene page display. If a mutation affects an activity that modifies another gene product, extensions may capture the affected enzyme, the affected substrate, or both. The relation assayed_enzyme is displayed as affecting activity of on gene pages, and assayed_substrate is shown as affecting substrate.\n4.  The phenotype display can be filtered to show subsets of the total set of annotations. Two filters, for ploidy and ontology terms, are available in the summary or detailed view. If there are both haploid and diploid genotypes curated, the first filter defaults to “Haploid or Diploid” to show all genotypes. The term filter lists several broad phenotypic categories derived from high-level FYPO terms:\n\n[FYPO annotation term filter]\n\nChoose one to restrict the annotation display to terms in the selected branch of FYPO. When term filtering is active, a message appears to indicate that not all annotations are shown:\n\n[filtered annotation display message]\n\nChange the selection back to “No filter” to see annotations to all terms.\n\nThe detailed single-locus phenotype view shows annotations to all FYPO terms, and includes more details for each annotation. It shows separate entries for repeat determinations of a given gene/term/allele/extension combination (if supported by more than one line of evidence and/or reported in more than one paper), and annotations to terms hidden in the summary view:\n\n[Single-locus FYPO detailed view on gene page]\n\n1.  The unique ID and name for a term in the phenotype ontology. The ID links to a page with additional information, including the term definition, any synonyms, relationships to other FYPO terms, and annotations to the term or its descendants. (See the ontology term page documentation for more.)\n\n2.  Allele details, including a symbol (if one is used in the literature) and description (where known). The column is headed “Genotypes” for consistency between the single- and multi-locus displays. Diploid genotypes specify both alleles for the locus, and are shown in bold. Each genotype name links to a page with full details (type, description, and expression) for its allele(s), links to gene pages, and a list of all phenotype annotations for the genotype. If you can provide a description for any allele shown as “unknown”, please contact the PomBase curators.\n\n3.  Mouse over the allele symbol to show the allele type, which indicates whether partial deletions or altered residues refer to amino acids or nucleotides, and expression level.\n\n4.  The phenotype display can be filtered to show subsets of the total set of annotations. The ploidy filter (not shown in this screenshot) selects haploid, diploid, or both genotypes where curated. The term filter, available in the summary or detailed view, lists several broad phenotypic categories derived from high-level FYPO terms. Choose one to restrict the annotation display to terms in the selected branch of FYPO. Change the selection back to “No filter” to see annotations to all terms. In the detailed view, annotations can also be filtered by evidence or throughput by choosing an descriptions from pulldown menus. Change the selection back to “No filter” to see annotations using any evidence type. Different filters, such as term and evidence, can be combined (note that some term/evidence combinations have no matching annotations). When any filtering is active, a message appears to indicate that not all annotations are shown.\n\n5.  A brief descriptor for the type of evidence that supports the annotation. The evidence categories come from the Evidence Ontology (ECO).\n\n6.  Information about experimental conditions, such as temperature, type of medium used, etc. Descriptions come from a small ontology maintained by PomBase curators.\n\n7.  The paper from which the annotation comes.\n\n8.  Phenotype annotations may have extensions to capture penetrance (proportion of a population that shows the phenotype) or severity (previously designated “expressivity”), or to document which gene or protein used in an assay for level, localisation, etc. S. pombe genes link to PomBase gene pages. Severity and penetrance use the relations has_severity and has_penetrance respectively, and can have values such as “high”, “medium”, or “low”. Penetrance can also use numerical values.

The relation assayed_enzyme is displayed as affecting activity of on gene pages, and assayed_substrate is shown as affecting substrate.\n\nSimilar displays are used for multi-locus phenotypes. Unless otherwise noted below, all items are as described above for single-locus phenotype displays.\n\nThe multi-locus summary shows FYPO terms and genotype descriptions:\n\n[multi-locus FYPO summary view on gene page]\n\n1.

Unlike traditional GO annotations, GO-CAM curation incorporates causal relationships between molecular activities and connects them to biological processes and cellular components. This approach provides a more detailed depiction of how gene products interact and function within biological systems. GO-CAMs specify entities like genes and proteins, their associated activities, and the causal links between them. These models are visualized as graphs, with nodes representing molecular activities and edges illustrating causal relationships, enabling a comprehensive understanding of interactions and pathways in biological processes.\n\nAt PomBase, we have begun representing biological pathways as GO-CAM models and displaying them on the relevant gene and process pages.\n\nFor further information see the Gene Ontology GO-CAM overview.\n\nMissing activities\n\nWe maintain a list of activities known or suspected to occur in fission yeast but not yet associated with a gene product.

When multiple pathways are selected, click on “View joined models” to see connections between the models in detail.\n\nThe “All Pathways Summary Map”\n\nDisplays a connected Summary Map, but also includes the set of pathway models that are not yet causally linked to any other pathway.\n\nView the Summary Map\n\nThe “Connected Summary Map”\n\nDisplays curated causal connections between GO-CAM pathways (inter-pathway connections)\n\nView the Connected Summary Map\n\nThe maps are fully interactive:\n\n-  Click on a pathway to view the title of the GO-CAM in the right-hand panel\n-  Click on the pathway title to open a new tab/window to visit a detailed view\n-  Multiple pathways can be selected by shift-clicking or shift-click and drag in the map\n -  When multiple pathways are selected, click on “View joined models” to see connections between the models in detail\n-  Zoom, drag, and rearrange nodes to explore the layout\n\n-\n\nMega Model\n\n[Mega Model]\n\nThe Mega Model view displays GO-CAMs in full detail, showing all intra- and inter-pathway connections. Initially, chemical inputs/outputs and target genes are hidden to reduce visual complexity — but you can toggle them on or off as needed.\n\nThe “All Pathways Mega Model”\n\nDisplays all curated GO-CAM pathway models in full detail:\n\n-  Each pathway is enclosed by a boundary (by default)\n-  All intra- and inter-pathway connections are shown\n-  Unconnected pathways are also included\n\nView the All Pathways Mega-model.\n\nThe “Connected Pathways Mega Model”\n\nDisplays only those GO-CAM pathway models that have inter-pathway connections, omitting unlinked pathways.\n\nView the Connected Pathways Mega-model.\n\n-\n\nNotes on Pathway Completeness\n\nNot all chemical intermediates are curated into pathways. However, for all catalytic steps, full reaction details can be found via links on the associated gene page, under the GO Molecular Function section (via Rhea reaction references). Currency metabolites (e.g., ATP, H₂O) are excluded to simplify pathways. Some known target genes are not yet included in pathways. Many inter-pathway connections are still being identified.\n\n-\n\nMissing activities\n\nWe maintain a list of activities known or suspected to occur in fission yeast that are not yet associated with any specific gene product. These pathway gaps were identified through GO-CAM curation and highlight areas for further research and annotation.\n\nMissing S. pombe activities\n\n-\n\nPathway joining activities\n\nA curated list of pathway models that share overlapping activities.

      "content" : "\n\nPomBase welcomes submissions of published large-scale phenotype data sets. We have devised a tab-delimited text file format for bulk phenotype data. A similar format is used for the downloadable file of single-allele phenotype data (with one more column at the start of each line to identify PomBase as the source; note that, because Database is column 1 in the downloadable file, column numbers differ by 1 between the download and upload formats).\n\nInclude a header line that labels the columns – use the entry in the Contents column below as the column header text.\n\nColumn  Contents  Example (from S. pombe)  Mandatory?

If you have nothing to put in one of the non-mandatory columns, include the header and leave the column blank in the rest of the rows.\n\n1.  Include the systematic ID for each gene. You can look up systematic IDs on gene pages, or refer to the file of all gene names from the dataset download page.\n2.  For help finding suitable ontology (FYPO) terms to describe your phenotypes, see the FYPO summary page and the FAQ on browsing FYPO. If you can’t find a term you need, email the helpdesk for assistance; we can add new FYPO terms as needed.\n3.  The allele description specifically describes the change; see table below.\n4.  In the Expression column, use one of these values: ‘overexpression’, ‘knockdown’, ‘endogenous’, ‘null’, ‘not specified’. Deletions should always have ‘null’ expression.\n5.  The Parental strain column is for the parental strain designation, such as 972 h-, 975 h+, etc. This column must be filled in, but you can use “unknown” if you don’t know the original background.\n6.  Use the Strain name (background) column for a lab’s in-house name/ID/designation for the background strain (i.e. the derivative of the parental strain that has selectable marker alleles etc.). The description in the Genotype column should match this background strain.\n7.  The Genotype description column is for alleles in the background, such as selectable markers; these details are optional. To avoid redundancy, do not repeat the allele of interest (from column 3 or 9) in the genotype column.\n8.  Gene names are optional. If you include them, use standard names in column 8 (see gene pages or the file of All Gene Names from the dataset download page).\n9.  Allele names are optional. If you include them, use column 9 for the preferred allele name, and put any alternative names in column 10.\n10. See note 9 above. Separate multiple entries with pipes (|).\n11. Allowed allele types, example descriptions, etc. are shown in the table below.\n12. For the Evidence column, we use a small selection from the Evidence Ontology (ECO). You are welcome to enquire with us in advance to find out which ECO terms/IDs fit your experiments, but we can accept files with brief descriptions (such as those in the Canto phenotype evidence option list), which curators will convert to ECO IDs.\n13. Similarly, Conditions use a small ontology maintained in-house by PomBase curators, and we can either advise you about which terms/IDs to use, or convert from text to IDs when we receive your file. Use multiple entries in cases where more than one condition detail applies at the same time (e.g. high temperature, minimal medium). Separate multiple entries with commas (,). Use separate lines if a phenotype is observed under more than one set of conditions (e.g. high and low temperature).\n14. Penetrance describes the proportion of a population that shows a cell-level phenotype. Use decimals, percents, or “high” (above 80%), “medium” (20-80%), or “low” (less than 20%). We will convert to suitable IDs for loading. Penetrance data will be displayed as annotation extensions on gene pages.\n15. Severity (formerly designated “expressivity) uses”high” (synonym: strong), “medium”, or “low” (synonym: weak). We will convert to suitable IDs for loading. Severity data will be displayed as annotation extensions on gene pages.\n16. The Extension column can be used to record when a mutation in one gene affects another gene or its product. For example, if a mutation in gene A decreases its ability to phosphorylate protein B, you can use the phenotype “decreased protein kinase activity” and put the ID for gene B in an extension. Multiple extensions can be included for a phenotype annotation. Separate extensions with a comma (,) if they combine to form a “compound” extension (two or more genes assayed together), or with a pipe (|) if they are independent. Most phenotype extensions will be independent and pipe-separated.\n17. The Reference column has the publication’s PubMed ID (PMID).\n18. The taxon will usually be 4896 (the NCBI taxon ID for Schizosaccharomyces pombe), although if you have an NCBI taxon ID for a specific S. pombe strain you are welcome to use it\n19. The date is the date on which the annotations are created; you may use the paper publication date or the date on which you prepare your data file. Format: YYYY-MM-DD\n20. We can currently capture only haploid and homozygous diploid datasets via PHAF files. Allowed values for this column are “haploid” and “homozygous diploid”. If the column is empty the dataset is assumed to be haploid. If you have a phenotype dataset for non-homozygous diploids please contact the Helpdesk\n\nDetails for allele types and descriptions:\n\nGeneral note: Nucleotide and amino acid positions should reflect the current sequence data in PomBase. Please refer to the Gene Coordinate Changes page to ensure that your residue position entries are up to date.\n\nFor protein-coding genes, number nucleotide residues from 1 starting with the A of the initiator ATG.\n\nAllele type (col. 11)  Example allele description (col. 3)  Notes\n - - -\n amino acid mutation  S123A  use one-letter code; if more than one change, separate with comma(s)\n deletion  deletion  use this description for complete deletions\n nucleotide mutation  C123A  if more than one change, separate with comma(s)\n disruption  pab1::ura4+  expression will usually, but not always, be null\n other  RGTPI inserted after I254  include a brief text description\n partial amino acid deletion  1-100 or A123*  indicate deleted residues; use comma-separated ranges for discontinuous deleted segments; use * for nonsense mutations.\n partial nucleotide deletion  500-800  indicate deleted residues; use comma-separated ranges for discontinuous deleted segments\n unknown  unknown  an allele name is required if the type and description are unknown\n wild type  wild type  use with altered expression (overexpression or knockdown) for single-allele phenotypes\n\nPlease contact the PomBase curators if you have any questions about what to use for Evidence, Conditions, etc., or anything else you need to represent your data in this format.\n\nReturn to the Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology page\n",

This will enable you to focus on. the most important terms in your enrichment.\n\nYou can slim your gene lists for any GO aspect (MF, BP or CC) using the PomBase “Advanced search”:\n\n1.  Upload your list\n2.  Click on the number of results in column 1 to access the complete list\n3.  Use the “slim with” option in the menu to slim your gene set\n\nA few other enrichment tools are described on the GO Consortium’s GO Enrichment Analysis page. If you choose one of these, we recommend that you only use an enrichment tool that allows you to upload a background set representing the genes used in your experiment. Even if you regard the whole genome as the relevant background, it is important to specify the background gene set explicitly to obtain meaningful results, especially if you have data only for protein-coding genes. For example, annotated tRNA genes can obscure enrichment of protein-coding genes annotated to translation.\n\nFor any GO analysis, we strongly recommend that you describe your approach fully in methods, and include the release details (number and/or date) for PomBase and the GO terms and annotations you use.\n",

      "content" : "\n\nPomBase curators use GO Biological Process annotations to indicate that a gene product is directly involved in a process or its regulation. FYPO annotations indicate when a mutation in a gene causes a change in a process, but do not say whether the effect is direct or indirect.\n\nMany mutant phenotypes reflect downstream effects of compromising an upstream process. In these cases, we annotate the phenotypes using FYPO terms, but do not annotate to the GO corresponding biological process term. We use “regulation of biological process” GO terms in cases where there is evidence for a gene playing a regulatory role in wild-type cells, but not where defects in an upstream process affect a downstream process (even though the latter is sometimes described as “regulating” or “modulating” the downstream process).\n\nFor example, a defect in cellular respiration may arise from mutations in genes directly involved in respiration, but also as a downstream effect of mutations in genes involved in mitochondrial translation, respiratory chain complex assembly, or ubiquinone biosynthesis. Similarly, DNA replication defects often also lead to defects in chromosome segregation; for the genes involved we annotate both replication and segregation phenotypes, but only replication in GO biological process.\n\nThe cell cycle offers an even more dramatic example of why we restrict usage of GO annotations. Over 750 genes can be mutated to give an elongated vegetative cell phenotype, which is traditionally interpreted as indicating that cell cycle progression is blocked in interphase. Most of these genes, however, are involved in transcription, translation, transport or splicing, and cell cycle delays seen in mutants are due to activation of cell cycle checkpoints by the abnormal processes. To annotate all 750 genes to “regulation of mitotic cell cycle” would obscure the genes that actually are part of the cell cycle regulatory network, greatly reducing the usefulness and precision of GO annotations.\n\nAlso see the FAQ on finding genes that affect a process.\n",

Comparing results with and without the allele restrictions may help resolve apparent discrepancies.\n\nNote that it not yet possible to search for specific conditions, or for penetrance, but we plan to add these features to the Advanced Search.\n\nIf, however, the allele and condition details are identical, annotation to both viable and inviable terms is probably an error (either one of the terms is wrong, or there are missing or incorrect details for the alleles and/or conditions).

See this pombelist post for details.\n\nThese additions bring the number of proteins with human orthologs to 3641 (72%), and the number with S. cerevisiae orthologs to 4006 (79%).\n\n“Unknowns” coverage update\n\n2024-07-10\n\nIn our 2019 work, “Hidden in plain sight: What Remains to be discovered in the eukaryotic proteome?”, we demonstrated that S. pombe had a higher GO biological process (BP) annotation coverage (86.7%) than both S. cerevisiae (83.5%) and human (82.8%).\n\nOf the model eukaryotes S. pombe has:\n\n1.  The highest percentage known coverage\n2.  The fewest phylum-specific proteins\n3.  The smallest proteome (despite a higher number of genes conserved in metazoa than S. cerevisiae)\n4.  Dedicated efforts to uncover unknown functions\n\nand is uniquely positioned to be the first eukaryote for which we know the process or pathway for every protein\n\nThe trend we identified continues to hold (S. pombe “knowns” have increased to 86.9% in 2024).

This update introduces nomenclature guidelines for noncoding RNA genes, a significant update to the allele and genotype nomenclature guidelines originally published in 1987. We took several steps to improve machine readability that will benefit the artificial intelligence/machine learning communities, and our own community curation program.\n\nLera-Ramírez et al. 2023, Revised fission yeast gene and allele nomenclature guidelines for machine readability, Genetics, 2023;, iyad143\n\n[“Revised fission yeast gene and allele nomenclature guidelines for machine readability”]\n\nAccessing the list of genes from a paper\n\n2023-09-20\n\nIt’s now possible to view the list of genes associated with a paper, using a new link on the publication pages.

This feature is possible thanks to the great work of Rhea.\n\nSee the 3-deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate synthase activity (GO:0003849) term page for an example.\n\n[]\n\nCuration update - “nonsense mutation” merged into “partial amino acid deletion”\n\n2023-04-26\n\nWe have decided to merge the allele type “nonsense mutation” into “partial amino acid deletion”. This has mainly been driven by the fact that allele types that combine different variants require new types, such as “amino_acid_deletion_and_mutation”, “amino_acid_insertion_and_deletion”, etc. Otherwise, we would have ended up with many more types, and at the gene product level (which is what we describe in PomBase in phenotype interactions), both truncations are equivalent. In the next update, this allele type will not be available in Canto.\n\nIn any case, even if two alleles produce the same truncation, such as ase1-D13* or ase1Δ(13-731), they would still have separate entries in PomBase, and they may have different phenotypes. We are only assigning them the same allele type.\n\nIf for your analysis you need to make a distinction between the two using our allele dataset allele dataset, you can always check the “Allele description” field for the presence of the “*” character to tell whether an allele includes a nonsense mutation.\n\nExperimental structures from PDB on gene pages\n\n2023-02-22\n\nThe experimental protein structures from PDB are now embedded on the PomBase gene pages using Mol*. For example: lsm7/SPCC285.12 gene page\n\nIf you select the “PDB structures” view on a gene page, experimental structures will set as your default. AlphaFold predictions will be shown for genes where an experimental structure are not available.\n\nWe now also display the structures on the associated publication page. For example: PMID:31010807 Garg et al.\n\nTo help locate proteins with experimental protein structures (currently 375), we have added a new query option to the “Advanced search”, currently under “commonly used queries”: “Proteins with PDB structures”\n\n[PDB structures on the lsm7 gene page]\n\nAlphaFold protein structure on gene pages\n\n2023-02-02\n\nAlphaFold protein structure are now embedded on the PomBase gene pages. We hope to embed the experimental structures from PDB in the near future.\n\n[Example from the mvp1 gene page]\n\nRevised canonical 5’ UTRs\n\n2023-01-24\n\nWe have revised the curated 5’UTRs using Transcription Start Sites (TSS) data (in vegetative growth/ minimal media) from the Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) data provided by Thodberg et al. All new gene structures were manually reviewed, around ~80 protein features had N-terminal coordinate revisions to align with TSS data.\n\nGlobal Core Biodata Resource status for PomBase\n\n2022-12-15\n\nWe are very pleased to announce that PomBase has been selected as one of the first Global Core Biodata Resource (GCBR) — a collection of 37 resources whose long term funding and sustainability is critical to life science and biomedical research worldwide. This accreditation recognizes PomBase as a primary knowledge base (adding value to data through expert curation) and as a crucial component of the research ecosystem. The candidate biodata resources were assessed against a series of rigorous criteria that included their scientific focus, the size and reach of their user communities, their quality of service, their governance, and their impact on global research.\n\nThank you to the entire community, especially the community curators who contribute regularly to our content, and our Scientific Advisory Board for their help and support.\n\nFor more information about the Global Biodata Coalition and PomBase’s new status, see the full press release.\n\nNext PombeTalks: Wednesday, December 14th\n\n2022-12-08\n\nThe next online PombeTalks will take place on Wednesday, December 14th.

For example, if a strain with genotype asp1-H397A has the phenotype decreased acid phosphatase activity affecting activity of pho1, but this phenotype is suppressed when rhn1 is deleted in that strain, we would annotate that the genes asp1 and rhn1 are part of a Phenotypic Suppression interaction.\n\n[GI old format]\n\nWe continue to display interactions in this format by default (showing only genes and interaction type), but if you expand the annotation, you can view the associated genotypes and phenotypes.\n\n[GI new format]\n\nIn the revised Canto interface, you can only annotate a genetic interaction from the double mutant phenotype annotation (by clicking on add.., as shown below).\n\n[GI annotation in Canto]\n\nOf course, genetic interactions predating this update are not linked to phenotypes or genotypes, but we are hoping to auto-annotate several of those. We will also prioritise for update any interactions where community curators have provided these details in an annotation comment. Finally, a big shoutout to Ana Sanchez and Angad Garg from the Shuman lab, for testing the new interface in numerous recently curated publications. The examples provided here are from Sanchez et al. 2019.

The Reciprocal Best Structure Hits (RBSH) approach provided 11 novel human homologues, including Pho86 -> NAT8 (ER acetyltransferase), Mug174 -> COIL (Coilin), Ach1 -> OXCT1 (succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid coenzyme A transferase), SPAC1952.08c -> CREG1, imt1 -> A4GALT (Lactosylceramide 4-alpha-galactosyltransferase), Rtc5 -> MEAK7 (MTOR associated protein). A further 41 novel orthologs were predicted between S. pombe and S. cerevisiae which had fallen under the radar for all other methods used at PomBase. Most of the novel connections provided additional functional information, or supported existing knowledge for poorly characterised proteins. See supporting data tables S4 and S5 for the complete list of predictions included in PomBase.

Henry Levin explains the background and significance of the work:\n\n“Transposon Integration Sequencing is a genome wide method of mapping sequences that contribute to growth. High throughput sequencing of transposon integration sites in haploid cells with single insertions reveals which genes are dispensable. Once propagated, cultures exhibit a pronounced lack of insertions in genes necessary for growth. This method, originally developed to study bacteria is now used to characterize the genomes of several yeasts including S. pombe. In earlier work we used the transposon Hermes to identify genes of S. pombe required for growth (Guo et al., 2013, Genetics, PMID:23893486). We have now applied Hermes and Transposon Integration Sequencing to identify genes important for the formation of heterochromatin (Lee et al., 2020, Cell Reports, PMID:32101745). Insertion sites from eight independent cultures can be visualized from PomBase as custom tracks on Jbrowse. Four cultures were of cells with ura4 silenced by cen1 heterochromatin. The other four cultures were\nof a strain without ura4. By passaging the cultures in 5-FOA we selected against cells with defects in heterochromatin. Genes that contributed to the formation of heterochromatin exhibited fewer insertions in cells with the cen1 copy of ura4 relative to the strain lacking ura4. To distinguish genes critical for heterochromatin from genes that contribute to a lesser extent we passaged cultures in 5-FOA for 5 generations and for 80 generations. While viewing these integration sites can indicate whether genes of interest contribute to heterochromatin formation you can also examine insertions in the cultures lacking ura4 to gage whether specific genes or noncoding sequences make significant contributions to growth.”\n\nNew genome browser datasets 2020-09-08\n\n2020-09-08\n\nThree new datasets in are now available in PomBase JBrowse (links go to PomBase publication pages, which in turn link to the browser with the tracks enabled):\n\n-  Transcription start sites from\n Li H, Hou J, Bai L, Hu C, Tong P, Kang Y, Zhao X, Shao Z. 2015.\n Genome-wide analysis of core promoter structures in Schizosaccharomyces pombe with DeepCAGE.\n PMID:25747261 DOI:10.1080/15476286.2015.1022704\n\n-  Transcript data from\n Eser P, Wachutka L, Maier KC, Demel C, Boroni M, Iyer S, Cramer P, Gagneur J. 2016\n Determinants of RNA metabolism in the Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome.\n PMID:26883383 DOI:10.15252/msb.20156526\n\n-  Transposon insertion sites from\n Lee SY, Hung S, Esnault C, Pathak R, Johnson KR, Bankole O, Yamashita A, Zhang H Levin HL.\n Dense Transposon Integration Reveals Essential Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors Promote Heterochromatin Formation.\n PMID:32101745 DOI:10.1016/j.celrep.2020.01.094\n\nSubmit your genome browser data\n\n2020-09-08\n\nWe have updated our HTP data submission procedure to make it easier for you to contribute your datasets for PomBase JBrowse:\n\nWe now provide spreadsheet templates in Excel and Open Document formats that gather the metadata we need to load and display your data.

Each slim page provides links to ontology term pages, annotated genes, and to download files containing the slim terms and IDs.\n\nNew ontology slimming options for advanced search results\n\n2020-05-20\n\nThe PomBase advanced search results panel now allows you to retrieve annotations to any of the fission yeast GO slims or the Mondo disease slim for genes in the results list. For example, you can query for all genes involved in a process and slim the resulting list by molecular function or disease association.\n\nPomBase adopts MONDO for disease gene curation\n\n2020-05-18\n\nPomBase has switched from the Disease Ontology (DO) to the Monarch Initiative’s Mondo Disease Ontology (Mondo) for disease gene curation. Mondo covers the same set of disease descriptions as DO, but has a richer hierarchical structure that classifies more specific descriptions into broad categories (e.g. anemia, cancer, kidney disease) suitable for a disease “slim” term set.\n\nPomBase curators are collaborating with Mondo to improve its disease classification, especially in areas that will support inferences that improve fission yeast disease annotation coverage in the new PomBase Mondo slim. The new disease slim is a work in progress, so if there is a particular disease grouping that you would find useful, please let us know.\n\nImproved gene-disease curation\n\n2020-05-18\n\nPomBase disease gene curation associates disease descriptors with fission yeast orthologs of human disease-causing genes. We have now increased coverage by adding new gene–disease term connections, with 3954 individual annotations to 1195 genes (up from 2588 and 905 respectively in January 2019). Disease associations now cover 24.5% of all fission yeast protein-coding genes, and over one third of those with human orthologs.\n\nPublished: Community curation in PomBase\n\n2020-05-11\n\nThe PomBase team has published an overview of our experience with community curation for fission yeast. In the article, out this week in Database, we reflect on the factors that have made our community’s remarkable, standard-setting achievements possible, and on the benefits we and PomBase users derive from this effort. We highlight the collaboration between authors and professional curators that arises via community curation, and how annotation quality improves as a result.\n\nWatch for invitations to curate your new papers, or see our community curation page for more information.\n\nPombeTalks May 13th\n\n2020-05-07\n\nThe next online PombeTalks will take place on Wednesday 13 May 2020 at 17:00 Central European Time.

Chromatin silencing is a phenotype resulting from the cumulative effects of these processes, and the Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO) accordingly retains a full suite of “chromatin silencing” terms.\n\nAnnotations using the GO chromatin silencing terms were reviewed, and either removed or reannotated based on what could be inferred from the phenotypes, resulting in a substantially revised set of heterochromatin assembly annotations. Further work is required, so please send us any corrections.\n\nPomBase now uses InterPro Version 79.0\n\n2020-05-05\n\nPomBase now uses InterPro Version 79.0, which integrates:\n\n-  128 new InterPro entries\n-  An update to PIRSF [3.10]\n-  151 new methods from the SUPERFAMILY (4), CATH-Gene3D (6), PIRSF (9), PANTHER (106), and CDD (26) databases.\n\nInterPro cites 48466 publications in PubMed.

Additional documentation is in preparation, and will be announced here when available.\nGenome sequences for additional Schizosaccharomyces species (S. japonicus, S. octosporus, and S. cryophilus) have recently become available in Ensembl Fungi, and the PomBase genome browser now includes comparative genomics data, with a view of region comparisons between each new genome and S. pombe.\n\nHuman ortholog data correction coming next month\n\n2014-02-19\n\nWe are about to release a data update for PomBase. Please note that there is still a problem with the human orthologs, as originally described on this list in mid-December (see archived message at http://listserver.ebi.ac.uk/pipermail/pombelist/2013/003926.html). We will correct this problem in the next PomBase release, and apologise for any inconvenience in the meantime.\n\nPomBase data update 2013-12-08\n\n2013-12-08\n\nWe have updated the data available on the PomBase web site to include manual curation through November 11, 2013. We now have future meetings available as a calendar or a list. The FAQ and some documentation pages have also been updated.\n\n2021-08-18: Updated to remove out-of-date links (events are now listed only as news items).\n\n2013 meeting mini-reviews published\n\n2013-11-24\n\nA series of mini-reviews, which were invited in association with the International Fission Yeast Meeting in London, have now been published in Biochemical Society Transactions: http://www.biochemsoctrans.org/bst/041/6/default.htm#c\n\n(Thanks to Jürg Bahler for this item)\n\nPomBase survey results available\n\n2013-11-20\n\nThe 2013 PomBase user survey closed at the end of October, and the results are available here (PDF at FTP site). Some highlights have been sent to the pombe mailing list. Many thanks to all who completed the survey.\n\nLink updated 2021-02-04\n\nNew “Target Of” gene page section\n\n2013-10-27\n\nWith the October 2013 update, gene pages now include “Target Of” annotations, which describe genes that affect the gene of interest. These annotations are essentially the reciprocal of ontology annotation extensions. Each “Target Of” annotation includes a relationship that indicates how the genes are connected, the name and product of the second gene, and a reference. Genes listed under “Target Of” may include upstream regulators or enzymes that modify the product of the gene of interest. For example, the “Target Of” annotations for cdc2 indicate that it is a substrate of, and regulated by, the kinase Wee1 and the phosphatase Cdc25 (among others). At present, “Target Of” data includes annotations derived from GO annotation extensions. We will soon extend it to include data from phenotype annotation extensions.\n\nPomBase data update 2013-10-21\n\n2013-10-21\n\nThe PomBase web site has been updated and now includes manually curated data through October 6, 2013. The number of community-curated papers continues to increase, ensuring that PomBase gene pages contain complete and up-to-date information. We are also pleased to announce that data tracks are now available in the genome browser for data from these two publications:\n\n-  Woolcock KJ, Gaidatzis D, Punga T, Bühler M. 2010. Dicer associates with chromatin to repress genome activity in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2011 Jan;18(1):94-9. doi: 10.1038/nsmb.1935 PMID:21151114\n-  Mata J. 2013. Genome-wide mapping of polyadenylation sites in fission yeast reveals widespread alternative polyadenylation. RNA Biol. 2013 Aug 1;10(8):1407-14. doi: 10.4161/rna.25758 PMID:23900342\n\nPomBase User Survey open\n\n2013-09-18\n\nTo guide current and future development, PomBase is now conducting a user survey, where we invite the fission yeast research community and any other PomBase users to evaluate the resources provided so far and comment on future priorities. The survey should take about 10 minutes to complete. Thank you for your participation!\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/s/NDM2BQX\n\nPomBase data update 2013-09-15\n\n2013-09-15\n\nWe have once again updated the data available on the PomBase web site. The data now includes manual curation through August 11, 2013. We are particularly pleased to note that this update includes annotations from several dozen papers curated by the S. pombe community. Many thanks to all who have done, or are doing, paper curation in Canto.\nWe also have an updated version of the S. pombe/human ortholog table available upon request.\n\nSend HTP data to PomBase\n\n2013-08-18\n\nAt the pombe 2013 meeting in London, PomBase staff received numerous requests display various published data, such as gene expression, histone modifications, etc. in the genome browser. To provide this, we now invite pombe researchers to send data: If you have published any high-throughput experiments that produced data  that can be associated with genome sequence coordinates, and thereby displayed as tracks on the PomBase genome browser, please fill out the HTP Data Submission Form. We can also accept large sets of phenotype data via the Phenotype Data Submission Form. If you have any problems or questions, contact us via the PomBase Helpdesk at any time.\n\nConnecting With PomBase\n\n2013-07-29\n\nTo complement the mailing list and twitter (}PomBase) it is now possible to follow the activities of PomBase and interact with other members of the pombe community via the new LinkedIn Group and Google+.\n\nLinks to these are also available from the front page of the PomBase.org site.\n\npombelist has moved\n\n2013-07-21\n\nUpdate: This item dates from July 2013, and the links in it no longer work. \\ Please see the Fission Yeast Community page for the current mailing list link. \\ (2020-02-18)\n\nThe pombe community mailing list, pombelist, has migrated from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and is now hosted by EBI. The new address is <pombelist}ebi.ac.uk> (please note that the old address no longer works, and will generate an automatic notification including the new address). The link to subscribe has also been updated, and the entire archive is available at the new location.\n\nPomBase website update\n\n2013-07-18\n\nWe’d like to highlight a few improvements we’ve just made to the PomBase website. Most of the changes affect the gene pages:\n\n-  The basic information display at the top of each gene page is more compact.\n-  For ontology annotations, the number of genes annotated is now shown, in a column labeled “Count” (also, changes behind the scenes involving this data mean that pages should load faster).\n-  Annotation extensions for GO are displayed using human-friendly text instead of internal “relation” labels.\n-  The Quick Links box can now be collapsed and expanded by clicking its header.\n-  Display of modification annotations using PSI-MOD is improved.\n\nIn addition, the Motif Search output now includes standard gene names and product descriptions. As we noted in a separate message, CDS coordinate files are once again available from the Downloads, with accurate and up-to-date data.\n\nPomBase launches community curation\n\n2013-06-23\n\nAt the pombe 2013 conference in London, PomBase officially launched its community curation initiative, which allows researchers to contribute publication-based annotations directly to the database. PomBase curators invite lab heads by individual email to curate newly published papers, providing links to the online curation system and its documentation. Researchers can also initiate curation of any older fission yeast publication in PubMed. Community curation uses the open-source online tool Canto.\n\nPomBase data update 2013-06-20\n\n2013-06-20\n\nPomBase data now includes manual curation through June 9, 2013, and represents complete annotation for 664 publications (as well as partial curation of many more). A highlight of this month’s literature curation update is the addition of over 9400 phenotype annotations, representing about 95% of the phenotype data from the recently published genome-wide study of cell cycle and cell morphology (Hayles et al. Open Biology May 2013; PMID:23697806). We have also improved the display of allele details for phenotype annotations. Other changes include better support for gene synonyms in the simple search, regular updates to the UTR data files, and a number of minor adjustments to external links in the annotation data tables and the external references section.\n\nPomBase data update\n\n2013-05-20\n\nWe have updated the data available on the PomBase web site. The data now includes manual curation through 13 May, 2013.\n\nGeneDB S. pombe decommissioned\n\n2013-05-13\n\nAs of 14 May 2013, the old GeneDB database for S. pombe is no longer available. This resource consisted of static web pages, was not updated after March 2012, and not supported by an underlying relational database. The PomBase site fully supersedes GeneDB S. pombe, and provides improved infrastructure that will meet the current and future needs of the fission yeast community. Please e-mail the helpdesk if you cannot find a replacement for any GeneDB functionality in PomBase.\n\nQuantitative gene expression data available in PomBase\n\n2013-05-07\n\nWe have extended the Gene Expression section of each gene page to support the display of quantitative expression data, and are now showing data from two publications:\n\n-  Marguerat S, Schmidt A, Codlin S, Chen W, Aebersold R, BählerJ. 2012. “Quantitative analysis of fission yeast transcriptomes and proteomes in proliferating and quiescent cells.” Cell 151:671-683.\n-  Wu JQ, Pollard TD. 2005. “Counting cytokinesis proteins globally and locally in fission yeast.” Science 310:310-314.\n\nWe will also soon refine the display of the new expression data, and can add more datasets upon request. We thank Sam Marguerat for preparing the data from both papers for inclusion in PomBase.\n\nWe have also updated the PomBase site to include manual curation through April 4, 2013, and we have updated the “all gene names” file on the PomBase ftp site.

Throughout his career, Carl supported yeast research both with his engineering expertise and with his good cheer. In tribute to Carl, the Singer family has now set up The Carl Singer Foundation, a charitable foundation dedicated to supporting scientific education in the field of yeast genetics. Questions about the foundation may be directed to Harry Singer at harry [at] thecarlsingerfoundation.org.\nCarl’s family would be happy to receive memories of Carl’s life at regards [at] singerinstruments.com.\n\nH/T SGD\n\nPombe 2013: registration & abstracts by Mon 8th April\n\n2013-04-02\n\nDear Pombe Fans,\n Please remember the imminent deadline (Monday 8th April) to register and submit abstracts for Pombe 2013: http://events.embo.org/13-pombe\n Abstracts are also required from all who have already been invited to talk.\n And do book your accommodation if you haven't yet done so.\n More details are in previous email forwarded below.\n Cheers,\n -Jürg & Jacky\n From: On Behalf Of Bahler, Jurg\n Sent: 18 March 2013 17:49\n To: pombelist at sanger.ac.uk\n Subject: [Pombelist] Pombe 2013: Accommodation, registration & abstracts\n Dear Pombe Afficionados,\n Only three weeks left to register and submit abstracts for Pombe 2013, by Monday 8th April: http://events.embo.org/13-pombe\n Speakers for 10 plenary talks and all workshop talks will be selected from abstracts, and there will be attractive poster prizes.\n Payment is only requested after registration, by 10th May.\n Important: if you require accommodation, please do book this real soon now. Especially the most cost-effective student accommodation (comfortable, with private bathrooms) may not be available much longer, as it will be put on general sale shortly. Both hotels and student accommodation will sell out in June, so you have to arrange it now. Information on accommodation is available here: http://events.embo.org/13-pombe/application.html\n We will provide a number of free registrations for which you can apply during online registration (a few of which are reserved for student members of The Genetics Society: you become eligible if you join them now). The meeting is also supported by the Biochemical Society, so if you are, or become, a member you can apply to them for student bursaries or, if you have been a member for at least 1 year, also for travel grants.\n We highly appreciate all the generous contributions from our sponsors so far:\n Platinum: EMBO\n Gold: Biochemical Society, Genetics Society, Formedium, Sunrise Science Products, Singer Instruments, F1000Research, PomBase/Wellcome Trust\n Silver: MDPI - Open Access Publishing, Hybrigenics, Infors, Life Technologies, Bioneer\n Bronze: Nature Communications, m2p labs, Imsol, Open Biology\n We look very much forward to welcoming you in London this June!\n All the best,\n -Jürg & Jacky\n\nData update on PomBase web site\n\n2013-04-01\n\nWe have once again updated the data available on the PomBase web site. The data now includes manual curation through March 6, 2013.\nWe now expect to be able to update PomBase data every month, and will soon have an automated pipeline in place. We thank all of you for your patience during the long months when updates were infrequent.\nYou should also see a few small improvements in the site:\n\n-  Ontology term pages now display the text definition for each term.\n-  FASTA sequence retrieval should be quicker, and less likely to time out, for large gene lists.\n-  There has been some tidying of the display of “extension” data for GO and phenotype annotations.\n\nLast month we noted an intermittent problem with the “Reference” column display in the data tables. The occurrence of this problem should now be greatly reduced, so please let us know if you see it recurring.\nAs usual, please don’t hesitate to alert us of any other problems with data or site performance, or if you have any questions.\n\nSpeed improvements and new data on PomBase web site\n\n2013-03-01\n\nWe have updated the data available on the PomBase web site. The data now includes manual curation through December 17, 2012, and reflects complete curation of an additional 70 papers.\nWe have also made some improvements “under the hood” that should make gene page loading much faster. Please let us know if you have any problems with gene pages loading slowly or incompletely, whether or not you have reported issues in the past.\nWe are aware that there is an intermittent problem with the “Reference” column display in the data tables – sometimes a PubMed ID appears instead of an author name and year. This problem will be fixed as soon as possible. Please alert us if you notice anything else odd or wrong.\n\nNew data and new features on PomBase web site\n\n2012-11-06\n\nWe are pleased to announce that we have updated both data and web site features for PomBase.\n\nMost importantly, we have added new data types, and upgraded the gene pages to display them.\n\nWe have also added more annotations of existing data types, bringing the web site content up to September 11, 2012. The new annotations include the first contributions to come in via the new community curation system, and we thank the researchers who are participating in the initial phase of community curation.\n\nNew annotation types:\n\n-  Phenotype annotations now use the Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO), and include allele details, expression levels, and experimental conditions. With FYPO, more detailed phenotypes can be described, and links between terms for related phenotypes support improved phenotype searches.\n-  Many GO annotations now include “annotation extensions” that provide additional specificity. For example, extensions may capture the substrate of a catalytic activity, the cell cycle phase during which a function or process occurs, or any of several other types of supporting information for the annotation. Annotation extensions are described in more detail below.\n\nYou can see these new data types on many gene pages, such as cdc2 or pka1.\n\nNew web site features:\n\n-  Annotation display - Gene page GO and phenotype displays have been revamped to show new annotation types described above.\n-  Ontology term pages - Each ontology term ID now links to pages with information about the term and lists of genes annotated to it.\n-  Ontology graph links - GO and phenotype annotation sections now include links to graphical ontology displays in the genome browser.\n-  Sequence highlighting - Sequence download now offers an option to show colour highlighting of regions such as UTRs, introns and exons.\n-  Versions - Each gene page now shows the current data version in the format PomBase:x.y, where x is the Ensembl Genomes (EG) version, and y is the Chado version. The sequence, and sequence feature locations, remain stable within any EG version, whereas annotations change with each Chado update.\n-  Protein family information is now included in the Protein Features gene page section.\n-  The Protein Feature section includes a link to the Pfam entry for a protein.\n-  Transcript source data (e.g. for UTR coordinates) is now displayed in the Transcript Features section.\n-  A Documentation page contains links to relevant portions of the Ensembl Genomes documentation. (More documentation will be added over the coming months.)\n\nWhat are annotation extensions?\n\nAnnotation extensions are a form of supporting data that can be added GO annotations (or other ontology annotations) to capture additional details not provided by the ontology term itself.\n\nThe information in GO annotation extensions encompasses several effector-target relationships, such as\n\n-  localisation dependencies\n-  substrates of functions, e.g. targets of a protein kinase – see the has_substrate extensions on Cdc2’s “protein serine/threonine kinase” (GO:0004674) annotations\n-  activators and inhibitors\n-  regulation targets of signalling pathways or transcription factors\n\nAdditional extensions describe spatial and temporal aspects of processes. For example, several S. pombe annotations now include extensions that indicate in which phase of the cell cycle a gene product is found in a cellular component or involved in a process – see the pka1 annotations to “nucleus” (GO:0005634) and “cytoplasm” (GO:0005737).\n\nYou may also find the GO wiki page on annotation extensions informative, although it is primarily aimed at curators.\n\nAnnotation extensions can also be used with phenotype annotations. The most common usage of phenotype annotation extensions is to capture which gene, protein, etc. was used in an assay. For example, the sam5 (G441E) mutation of pka1 causes nuclear accumulation of Ste11. This is represented by annotation to the ontology term “nuclear protein accumulation” (FYPO:0000255), with the extension “assayed_using(PomBase:SPBC32C12.02)”. Extensions can also indicate expressivity or penetrance for a phenotype.\n\nPomBase web site fully live\n\n2012-07-01\n\nNote (2023-06-09): This is an archived news item about PomBase V1. See the documentation page to learn new Advanced search in PomBase V2.\n\nWe are pleased to announce that the PomBase web site, www.pombase.org, is now fully live; the preview phase has ended. The site has been updated with an assortment of new features, datatypes, and bug fixes.\n\nMore recent data, reflecting additions and changes through March 20, 2012, are now available on gene pages and in search results.\n\nThe updated site features a Gene List Search that provides behavior equivalent to GeneDB’s List Download. You can now type or paste lists into the Gene Systematic IDs and Gene Names filters, and use the Query History to combine a gene list search with other search options. For convenience, there is a direct link to a search page pre-configured to accept a list of systematic IDs available in the Find menu, on the Find page, and here: http://www.pombase.org/spombe/query/builder?filter=12\n\nThe Advanced Search also now offers:\n\n-  options to search GO, FYPO, and other ontologies by term name or ID;\n-  autocomplete for ontology term name search;\n-  ability to search for genes in a region, such as centromeres or telomeres;\n-  improved organization of filter selections.\n\nWe have also fixed a Sequence Download error reported by some users, so that the “CDS”, CDS + UTRs”, and “CDS + UTRs + Introns” options now retrieve the correct sequences.\nIn addition, numerous minor improvements have been made. Please send any questions or comments on the PomBase web site to us at <<helpdesk}pombase.org>>.\n\nPomBase preview launch\n\n2011-11-27\n\nA preview of PomBase, the new model organism database for the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, has been announced to the S. pombe community for testing and feedback.
