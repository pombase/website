### esyN network visualizations in PomBase

PomBase has implemented network visualisations for fission yeast in
"esyN, using data curated by BioGRID and PomBase.
esyN is a web-based tool for building, sharing, and viewing network data
developed by Dan Bean and Giorgio Favrin in the [Cambridge Systems
Biology Centre](http://www.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk), University of Cambridge,
UK.\
\
On gene pages, we have links to gene-specific interaction networks in
esyN in the table headers of the Interactions sections:

-   The Genetic Interactions section links to all interactions centred
    on the gene and curated in BioGRID
-   The Physical interactions section has links to two datasets:
    -   All physical interactions curated in BioGRID for the gene
    -   Interactions for the gene in the PomBase [High Confidence
        Physical Interaction Network
        (HCPIN)](/documentation/high-confidence-physical-interaction-network)
