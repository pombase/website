Our work to using Pfam-N to identify distant orthologs between fission
yeast and human or budding yeast was included in the
[Pfam NAR update](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkae997).
Check out the rest of the paper to see recent improvements to
Pfam as they continue to work toward comprehensive coverage of the
protein universe.
