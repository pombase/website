Additional protein features and modifications inferred from sequence
context by the UniProt database have been imported to supplement our
large curated experimental datasets. [Imported data](/reference/PMID:36408920)
includes propeptides, active site binding sites, mitochondrial
targeting signal and 212 additional signal peptides. Features are
listed in the "protein domains and properties" section of the gene
page and features with coordinates are displayed in the protein
feature viewer.  Signal peptides and mitochondrial targeting signals
from all sources can also be retrieved using the queries in the
"domains features and motifs" section of the "[Advanced
Search](/query)".  We have also imported an additional 445 inferred
modifications from UniProtKB to supplement the ~69,000 PomBase curated
modifications.
