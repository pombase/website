The Gene Ontology Consortiumâ€™s latest publication,
*A compendium of human gene functions derived from evolutionary modelling*,
is [out in Nature](https://nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08592-0)!
PomBase is proud to have contributed to this extensive effort, which
leverages all model organism data to support phylogenetic transfer of
annotation. Fission yeast GO data currently support
[6,461 human gene annotations](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/annotations?taxonId=9606&taxonUsage=descendants&withFrom=PomBase). \
Beyond annotation, PomBase played a crucial role in reviewing automated
inferences, ensuring accuracy across species. Over seven years, PomBase
submitted nearly 600 PAINT update requests, helping refine functional
annotations.
