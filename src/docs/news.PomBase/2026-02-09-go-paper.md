PomBase has contributed to the new [Gene Ontology database update](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaf1292),
which focuses on major ontology updates in the past 2 years and the
dramatic increase in the number of GO-CAM models, "with over 1500
models of metabolic and signaling pathways, primarily in human, mouse,
budding and fission yeast, and fruit fly".

Please update your citation details for GO to the new publication.
