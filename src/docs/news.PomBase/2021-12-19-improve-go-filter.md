### Improved options for filtering annotations by cell cycle phase

The Gene Ontology annotation filter for “during” specific cell cycle phases is now included on the “Summary” 
view in addition to the “Details” view. Available phases have been extended to cover all phases used, and to provide  
useful grouping terms. This filter is “ontology aware” (i.e. a search on interphase will also display G1/S/G2 
phase annotation). The phase filter is most useful on pages that display increasing volume of 
phase-specific curation (such as cdc2). The revised phase filter options are also available in the gene expression section.

The  phase filters are located at the top right of GO and gene expression annotation sections:
