<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->

We have released the first [36 curated biological pathways](/gocam),
covering 466 proteins.

These pathways were curated using GO-Causal Activity Modeling
(GO-CAM), which provides a system to represent biological processes as
a causal network by connecting GO molecular function terms
(activities), encoded by individual gene products.

GO-CAM model for [vitamin B6 metabolic process](/gocam/pombase-view/docs/66c7d41500001171):
