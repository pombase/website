### MobiDB disorder predictions
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->

We now use [MobiDB-lite](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx015)
for identifying disordered regions replacing IUPred.
Unlike single-residue level predictions, MobiDB-lite focuses on
providing a single, consensus-based prediction optimized for high
specificity, particularly for detecting long disordered regions with
minimal false positives.
