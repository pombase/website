#### Protein feature viewer added to gene pages
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: pombase-logo-32x32px.png -->

PomBase gene pages now include a protein feature widget.  This tool
shows protein features in the context of amino acid sequence.  It
includes:

  - manually curated amino acid substitution positions
  - Pfam domains
  - protein modifications
  - protein properties: low complexity regions, disordered regions,
    coiled coil regions and predicted trans-membrane domains

Visit the [cdc15 gene page](/gene/SPAC20G8.05c) to see an example.

Hover over features for more information, such as allele descriptions
and Pfam domain IDs.

Follow the "View all protein features â€¦" link for a detailed view
on the dedicated protein features page that includes:

  - details of the manually curated amino acid substitution allele changes
  - manually curated partial amino acid deletions

Thanks to the team at [RCSB PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/) for providing
the [Open Source software](https://github.com/rcsb/rcsb-saguaro) used
to implement this feature.
