### NEW: The Missing activity list - A list of potential "pathway holes"
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: pombase-logo-32x32px.png -->

During GO-CAM pathway curation, we have sometimes been unable to locate
a specific annotated activity.

We have generated a [list of these missing activities](/status/missing-gocam-proteins)
from the GO-CAM models.

We expect this list to continue to grow as we curate more pathways.
Please note that in some cases these may not be present, or a reaction
may be spontaneous.

The list is currently linked to from the
[gene characterisation page](/status/gene-characterisation)
and from the [GO-CAM pathway list](/documentation/gocams).

Example of pathway with a missing gene / pathway hole:
[nitrogen cycle metabolic process (GO:0071941)](/gocam/pombase-view/gene/665912ed00002626/SPAC1F7.09c/dal2)
