The new PomBase database update is now available at Genetics:
[PomBase in 2026: Expanding Knowledge, Modeling Connections](https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyag001).
In this update, we outline recent progress in literature curation,
introduce new tools, and enhancements designed to better support the
research community. We highlight our recent effort to curate
biological pathways and modules as causal networks using
[Gene Ontology - Causal Activity Modelling (GO-CAM)](/gocam/)
and describe new features that utilise these models to guide and
inform hypothesis-driven research.
