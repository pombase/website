Version 2 of the JBrowse genome browser is now available on PomBase.  
[PomBase JBrowse V2](https://www.pombase.org/jbrowse2/)

You can now browse the S. pombe genome, and visualize all of our hosted datasets, 
in a new, nicer interface. JBrowse V2 possesses several new features, such as the possibility
to show regions of different chromosomes in the same view, the ability to toggle on or off the
display of the forward, reverse and translation sequences for the reference sequence track, 
and the support of Hi-C data. You can find the complete list of new features on [this page](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/features/)
 
Both the old (V1) and the new versions of JBrowse are linked to from the PomBase front page 
and at the top of the Genome browser widget on the gene pages.
