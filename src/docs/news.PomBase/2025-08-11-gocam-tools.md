### New Interactive Views for Exploring GO-CAM Models
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: gocam-32px.png -->

Introducing two new interactive views designed to support the
exploration and use of GO-CAM (Gene Ontology Causal Activity Model)
data.

##### **Summary Map**

The **Summary Map** provides a high-level, visual overview of how
individual GO-CAM models are causally connected—without displaying
their internal structure. This allows you to quickly see relationships
between pathways at a glance:

 - [View all models - connected band unconnected](/gocam/summary/all)
 - [View only connected models](/gocam/summary/connected)

The maps are fully interactive:

 - Click on a box to open the corresponding GO-CAM
 - Click on a relationship arrow to explore connections between models
 - Zoom, drag, and rearrange nodes to explore the layout

##### **Mega Model**

The **Mega Model** view displays GO-CAMs in full detail, showing all
intra- and inter-model connections. Initially, chemical inputs/outputs
and target genes are hidden to reduce visual complexity—but you can
toggle them on or off as needed.

 - [View all models](/gocam/mega-model/all)
 - [View only connected models](/gocam/mega-model/connected)

Like the Summary Map, Mega Models are fully interactive:

 - Zoom and pan to navigate the network
 - Click on gene icons or pathway boxes to access detailed information
   and links to full GO-CAM pathways
