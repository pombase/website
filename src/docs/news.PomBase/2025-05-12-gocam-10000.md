### PomBase Expands GO-CAM Pathway Models for Fission Yeast
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->

PomBase has more than doubled its curated
[GO-Causal Activity Modelling](/documentation/go-cam-pathway-models)
(GO-CAM) pathway models—from 36 to 74—now covering over
[1000 fission yeast proteins](/results/from/id/f99d8133-3206-4941-b44e-9314e7cae3d2).
These causal models span key biological pathways, with a focus on
mitochondrial processes through collaboration with FlyBase and
UniProtKB. New tools for pathway visualization and interaction are in
development and will be showcased at Pombe 2025.

Explore the models and gaps on the
[PomBase GO-CAM page](/documentation/go-cam-pathway-models).

Example GO-CAM model: \
[L-proline biosynthetic process (GO:0055129), proline catabolic process to glutamate (GO:0010133), glutamine biosynthetic process (GO:0006542))](/gocam/view/docs/678073a900003902)
