We have recently assigned new orthologs utilising
[Pfam-N](https://xfam.wordpress.com/2024/05/31/pfam-n-version-3-enhancing-pfam-coverage-of-uniprot-with-computer-vision-deep-learning-techniques/)
protein family extensions,
[JackHMMER](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/hmmer/search/jackhmmer)
iterative searches, and [FoldSeek](https://search.foldseek.com/search)
structural alignments.

New orthologs:\
We have identified orthologs of human
[MEIOB](/gene/SPAP27G11.08c),
[PEX26](/gene/SPCC16C4.04),
[OCIAD1 and OCIAD2](/gene/SPBC19G7.18c),
[SIKE1 and FGFR1OP2](/gene/SPAC2C4.10c),
[NGRN](/gene/SPCC1393.11),
[TFAM](/gene/SPAC4G9.11c),
[NDUFA3](/gene/SPAC15A10.17),
[PEX26 (Sc PEX15)](/gene/SPCC16C4.04),
[CCZ1](/gene/SPAC1805.10). \
Plus orthologs of *S. cerevisiae*
[MNE1](/gene/SPBC16A3.03c),
[OM14](/gene/SPBC11C11.06c),
[PEX22](/gene/SPAC57A7.15c), and
[CAF130](/gene/SPAC23H4.16c).

We have also assigned other sequence orphans to known protein families.
See [this pombelist post](https://lists.cam.ac.uk/sympa/arc/ucam-pombelist/2024-08/msg00000.html)
for details.

These additions bring the number of proteins with human orthologs to
[3641 (72%)](/results/from/id/8335a7b3-5105-4414-9743-bb6422692858),
and the number with S. cerevisiae orthologs to
[4006 (79%)](/results/from/id/12a88b3a-9bab-4eae-a7e0-bb137b55d851).
