### Changes to protein features view on gene pages
<!-- pombase_flags: frontpage -->
<!-- newsfeed_thumbnail: pombase-logo-32x32px.png -->

The protein domains and features section of the gene pages now uses
the same protein feature display as the "full view" linked to
from the summary section.  This provides a consistent view of protein
features across the website. We now also display active and binding
sites, signal peptides, transit peptides, TMMs, and other Sequence
Ontology features in this view.

[Example from cpy1](gene/SPAC19G12.10c):
