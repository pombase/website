# Can I access ${database_name} via an API?
<!-- pombase_categories: Tools and resources -->

### Ensembl API
~~This API can be used to query *${species_abbrev}* data in Ensembl Genomes.  Note
that EG is updated much less frequently than ${database_name}, so EG data will
rarely be as up-to-date as the ${database_name} web site.~~

Update 2026-01-15: The Ensembl Genomes API is currently unavailable.
