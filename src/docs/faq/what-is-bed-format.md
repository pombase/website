# What is BED format?
<!-- pombase_categories: Data submission and formats -->

BED is a tab-delimited text format that defines a feature track for a
genome browser.

BED format is described in the [UCSC Genome Bioinformatics FAQ](http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1), and the
[Broad Institute IGV file format guide](https://igv.org/doc/desktop/#FileFormats/DataTracks/) provides
additional information.
