# How do I download a table of all modifications?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data,Using ontologies -->

Specific modified residues is not a download option from the query
builder.  If you want build a table of all residues with a specific
modification, download the table in the
[modifications data directory](/latest_release/protein_features/protein_modifications.tsv), and filter
for your modification of interest.  The column descriptions are in the
README.

This dataset includes all high throughput and low throughput curated
data.  Note that some older datasets have no residue information.
