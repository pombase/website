# How can I obtain the list of human and *${species_abbrev}* orthologs?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data,Genome statistics and lists,Orthology -->

The current version of the manually curated list of orthologs and
orthologous groups identified between fission yeast and human is
available for download from the
%%if db=PomBase
[curated_orthologs directory](/latest_release/curated_orthologs/)
%%end db=PomBase
%%if db=JaponicusDB
[orthologs FTP directory](/data/orthologs/)
%%end db=JaponicusDB
(linked from the [Datasets](/datasets) page).
