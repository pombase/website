# Can I find all of the unconserved (orphan) genes in fission yeast?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome statistics and lists,Finding data -->

Orphan genes are generally defined as genes without homologs in other
organisms. In PomBase, protein-coding genes conserved in the
*Schizosaccharomyces* genus are distinguished from genes conserved
only in *S. pombe*.

To retrieve either set of genes, use the "Taxonomic conservation"
query in the [Advanced Search](/query). Choose "Schizosaccharomyces
specific" for genes found in more than one *Schizosaccharomyces*
species, or "Schizosaccharomyces pombe specific" for genes found only
in *S. pombe.* See the
[Advanced Search documentation](/documentation/advanced-search)
for help with performing searches.

Historical note: Prior to August 2014, PomBase and its predecessor
GeneDB referred to single-copy genes conserved within, but not outside,
the *Schizosaccharomyces* genus as "sequence orphans". See the 
[Gene characterisation statistics history](/status/gene-characterisation-statistics-history)
page for more details (note that the gene characterisation
classifications reflect whether a gene has been studied experimentally
as well as the extent of its conservation).
