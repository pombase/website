# Can I search for a gene list and retrieve results in the same order as in the input list?
<!-- pombase_categories: Finding data -->

At present this is not possible; all advanced search results are
ordered alphabetically by gene symbol, or by systematic ID for unnamed
genes, by default. Click the "Product" column header to sort
alphabetically by product description. We plan to add an option to
preserve input order soon.

In the meantime, we suggest that you download the results using the
"Details" link, and import them into a spreadsheet. You can then
combine the results with other data in the spreadsheet, and use the
spreadsheet software to sort on any column.
