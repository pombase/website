# Can I visualise networks in PomBase?
<!-- pombase_categories: Tools and resources -->

This is an area of active development at PomBase.
We are building causal pathways using [GO-CAMs](/gocam).  Future work
will include the ability to view all genetic and physical interactions
in the context of the causal model, or independently.
