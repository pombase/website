# Can I visualise networks in PomBase?
<!-- pombase_categories: Tools and resources -->

This is an area of active development at PomBase. We are building
causal models of biological pathways using GO-CAM. The list of all the
pathways we have curated can be accessed from our
[GO-CAM pathways page](/gocam), along with our 
[Mega-Model](/gocam/mega-model/connected) and
[Summary Map](/gocam/summary/connected),
which provide systems-level visualisations of pathways
interconnection. Additionally, you can use the gene list
functionalities to visualise any list of genes, such as all the
genetic and physical interactors of a gene or protein, in the context
of the causal models.
