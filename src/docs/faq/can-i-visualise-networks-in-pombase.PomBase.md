# Can I visualise networks in PomBase?
<!-- pombase_categories: Tools and resources -->

This is an area of active development at PomBase.  The tool we
previously used to visualize genetic and physical interaction networks
(EsyN) is now deprecated.  We are actively building causal pathways
using [GO-CAMs](/documentation/go-cam-pathway-models).  Future work
will include the ability to view all genetic and physical interactions
in the context of the causal model, or independently.
