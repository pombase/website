# How can I join pombeSlack?
<!-- pombase_categories: Community -->

The [pombe Slack account](https://spombe.slack.com/) is separate from
PomBase and pombelist, and not run by PomBase staff. To join, email
one of the pombe Slack admins ([Gautam Dey, EMBL](https://www.embl.de/research/units/cbb/dey/members/index.php?s_personId=CP-60034206),
[Mary Elting, NCSU](https://physics.ncsu.edu/eltinglab/team/mary-elting/) or 
[Maitreyi Das, Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/biology/people/faculty-directory/maitrey-das.html)).
