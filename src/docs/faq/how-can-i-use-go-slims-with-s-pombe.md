# How can I use GO slims with *${species_abbrev}*?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome statistics and lists,Tools and resources,Using ontologies -->

The [Fission Yeast GO slim pages](documentation/pombase-go-slim-documentation)
provide generic GO slims for *${species_abbrev}*, and show total genes
annotated to each term directly or to any of its descendants.

If you want GO slim annotations for your own list of *${species_abbrev}* genes,
use the advanced search "Gene symbols and IDs" option, and then use the "Slim"
button on the search results page. See the [advanced search
documentation](documentation/advanced-search) for more information.

If you want to use a different slim, we recommend using the [GO Term
Mapper](http://go.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/GOTermMapper) at Princeton.
Upload your list of genes, and select "${genus_and_species}
(${database_name})" in the Organism pulldown. For the slim, select one of the
radio buttons, or scroll down to Advanced Options to choose GO terms
to make up a custom slim. GO Term Mapper's interface and documentation
should make the rest straightforward, but let ${database_name} staff know if
you have any problems.

For further information on using the generic *${species_abbrev}* slims, or on
creating your own GO slim, please see the [Fission Yeast GO slimming tips](/browse-curation/fission-yeast-go-slimming-tips) page.
