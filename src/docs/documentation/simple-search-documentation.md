## Simple search

The simple search is available via the search box in the header on every
${database_name} page:

The simple search works for:

- Fission yeast gene symbols, synonyms, and systematic IDs
- Fission yeast gene product descriptions
- Human orthologs of fission yeast genes &mdash; search by standard gene symbols
- Budding yeast orthologs of fission yeast genes &mdash; search by standard gene symbols, ORF names, or SGD IDs
- Publications &mdash; search by PubMed ID
- Ontology terms &mdash; search by term ID

Start typing to see a pulldown of autocomplete matches, then choose
one, or if there is a single match simply hit return, to go to the
matching gene page.

For publications or ontology terms, type or paste an ID as
directed. If no autocomplete suggestions appear, enter the ID and hit
return to execute the search.
