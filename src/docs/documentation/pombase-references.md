## PomBase References (PB_REFs)

PomBase references are a set of abstracts that can be cited to support
annotations. It is modeled after the
[GO reference collection](http://www.geneontology.org/doc/GO.references).

PB_REFs usually describe the method or project used to generate a
specific set of annotations when no publication reference is
appropriate.
