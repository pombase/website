## GO-CAM pathways

GO-CAMs, or Gene Ontology Causal Activity Models, are a framework
within the Gene Ontology (GO) project that aims to represent complex
biological processes in a structured, formal, and computable
manner. GO-CAMs extend the traditional GO annotations by incorporating
causal relationships between activities (e.g., molecular functions)
and linking them to biological processes and cellular components. This
approach allows for a detailed representation of how gene products
interact and function within a biological context.  GO-CAMs involve
specifying entities such as genes and proteins, their activities, and
the causal relationships between them. These models are represented as
graphs, where nodes depict molecular activities and edges denote
causal relationships. This graphical representation captures complex
interactions and pathways, providing a comprehensive view of
biological processes.

At PomBase, we have begun representing biological pathways as GO-CAM
models and displaying them on the relevant gene and process pages.
