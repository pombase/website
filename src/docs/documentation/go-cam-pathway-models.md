## GO-CAM curated biological pathways

GO-CAMs, or Gene Ontology Causal Activity Models, are a framework
developed within the Gene Ontology (GO) project to represent complex
biological pathways in a structured, computable format. Unlike
traditional GO annotations, GO-CAM curation incorporates causal
relationships between molecular activities and connects them to
biological processes and cellular components. This approach provides a
more detailed depiction of how gene products interact and function
within biological systems. GO-CAMs specify entities like genes and
proteins, their associated activities, and the causal links between
them. These models are visualized as graphs, with nodes representing
molecular activities and edges illustrating causal relationships,
enabling a comprehensive understanding of interactions and pathways in
biological processes.

At PomBase, we have begun representing biological pathways as GO-CAM
models and displaying them on the relevant gene and process pages.

### Pathway holes

We maintain a list of activities known or suspected to occur in fission yeast but
not yet associated with a gene product. These “pathway holes” have
been identified through GO-CAM causal model curation.
