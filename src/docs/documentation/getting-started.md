## Types of pages in ${database_name}

${database_name} is centred around **Gene Pages** so this is a good
place to begin to familiarise yourself with how data is organised.  An
example is the gene page for
%%if db=PomBase
[pol1, the DNA polymerase alpha catalytic subunit](/gene/SPAC3H5.06c).
%%end db=PomBase
%%if db=JaponicusDB
[pol1, the DNA polymerase alpha catalytic subunit](/gene/SJAG_05239).
%%end db=JaponicusDB

To find other genes, use the search box at top right of every page.
It's possible to search using the gene symbol ("pol1") or the systematic
identifier
%%if db=PomBase
("SPAC3H5.06c").
%%end db=PomBase
%%if db=JaponicusDB
("SJAG_05239").
%%end db=JaponicusDB

At the top of the page, you will find some basic information about the
locus and gene product.  Immediately below is a view of the
[predicted structure from AlphaFold](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/P28040).
Other views are possible using the buttons beside the structure view
("Protein features", "Genome browser", etc.)

</summary>
<p>The same gene may be known by different names. In ${database_name},
we consider three types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Systematic ID</strong>, a unique identifier that represents
exclusively this gene in <em>${genus_and_species}</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Gene standard name,</strong> the most commonly used name of
this gene, that may not be exclusive to pombe, and could even be used as
a synonym of other fission yeast genes. This name will frequently be the
same as the orthologous gene in <em>S. cerevisiae</em>, (the ortholog of
pol1 in <em>S. cerevisiae</em> is also called pol1), but be aware there
are many notable examples where the same name is used for different
genes in other species. Some genes don’t yet have a standard name, but
if you study them you can <a
href="/submit-data/gene-naming-guidelines">name them</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Synonyms,</strong> alternative names for this gene that have
been used in the literature before. We encourage you to use the standard
name in publications where possible.</li>
</ul>
</details>

On the left side of the **Gene Page**, there is a menu listing the sections in the page (GO molecular function, GO biological process, etc.). Each section contains different kinds of annotations. Go through them and click on the <img src="/assets/info_icon.svg" style="width: 1em"/> button to see what information is displayed in each section. Most sections show a “summary view” of the experimentally relevant information so that it is easier to consume the biological context. The “Show details” link uncollapses the section to show important associated information such as evidence and provenance, often presenting multiple sources supporting the same annotation. You also will notice that many of the displayed annotations are blue and link to other types of pages:

- **GO term pages**: contain the **definition** of the GO term and lists all the **genes annotated to a specific GO term** and its “child” terms.

    <ul>
    <li>GO annotations <strong>link</strong> <strong>a gene to a GO
    term</strong> that describes the molecular function(s) of its gene
    products, the process(es) they are involved in their localisation in the
    cell or their presence in macromolecular complexes.</li>
    <li>A term name may change over time, but if the <em>meaning</em> of a
    definition changes the term must be obsoleted, and the associated genes
    reannotated to the correct definition. This makes the term definition
    critical and curators must always ensure that the definition is
    appropriate for the annotation.</li>
    <li>A GO term can be linked to several parent terms through
    relationships. Let’s take the term <a
    href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0001055">GO:0001055</a> (RNA
    polymerase II activity), graph below.
    <ul>
    <li>RNA polymerase II activity is a GO molecular function.</li>
    <li>This activity is a specific type of <a
    href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0003899">GO:0003899</a>
    (DNA-directed 5’-3’ RNA polymerase activity), so <a
    href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0001055">GO:0001055</a> is
    linked to <a
    href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0003899">GO:0003899</a>
    through an <strong>is_a</strong> relationship.</li>
    <li>This activity is part of the GO biological process <a
    href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0006366">GO:0006366</a>
    (Transcription by RNA polymerase II), so <a
    href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0001055">GO:0001055</a> is
    linked to <a
    href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0006366">GO:0006366</a>
    through a <strong>part_of</strong> relationship.</li>
    <li>This activity occurs at the GO cellular component <a
    href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0000785">GO:0000785</a>
    (chromatin) so <a
    href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0001055">GO:0001055</a> is
    linked to <a
    href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/GO:0000785">GO:0000785</a>
    through a <strong>occurs_in</strong> relationship. <img

    </ul></li>
    <li>In ${database_name} GO term pages, for simplicity we do not present
    inter-ontology links and only link to children and parent terms of the
    same ‘aspect’ (i.e molecular function, biological process, cellular
    component) these include terms related to each other by the
    relationships is_a, part_of and the 3 ‘regulates’ relationships. For
    instance, in the page of GO molecular function <a
    href="https://www.pombase.org/term/GO:0003899">GO:0003899</a>
    (DNA-directed 5’-3’ RNA polymerase activity):
    <ul>
    <li>We include <a
    href="https://www.pombase.org/term/GO:0001055">GO:0001055</a> (RNA
    polymerase II activity), which is also a GO molecular function, linked
    to GO:0003899 through an <strong>is_a</strong> relationship</li>
    <li>We do not include the cellular component <a
    href="https://www.pombase.org/term/GO:0000428">GO:0000428</a>, linked to
    the molecular function GO:0003899 through a <strong>capable_of</strong>
    relationship.</li>
    <li>If you expand a term by clicking on the ‘+’ icon on its left, you
    can see the relationship to the term in the current page.</li>
    </ul></li>

- **Phenotype pages** the Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO) term pages: provide the phenotype **definition** and list all the **genotypes annotated to a FYPO term** and its 'child’ terms, as well as link to the parent terms. Read more…

    <ul>
    <li>As for GO, the simplest relationship between FYPO terms is
    <strong>is_a</strong>, in which the child term describes a more specific
    phenotype than the parent. For example, <a
    href="https://www.pombase.org/term/FYPO:0006885">FYPO:0006885</a>
    (decreased protein level at mitotic spindle) <strong>is_a</strong> <a
    href="https://www.pombase.org/term/FYPO:0001324">FYPO:0001324</a>
    (decreased protein level during vegetative growth), which in turn
    <strong>is_a</strong> <a
    href="https://www.pombase.org/term/FYPO:0001325">FYPO:0001325</a>
    (altered protein level during vegetative growth).</li>
    <li>Other relationships also exist, such as <strong>output_of</strong>,
    which links a given phenotype to another that causes it. For example, <a
    href="https://www.pombase.org/term/FYPO:0000118">FYPO:0000118</a>
    (multiseptate vegetative cell) is <strong>output_of</strong> <a
    href="https://www.pombase.org/term/FYPO:0000032">FYPO:0000032</a>
    (abnormal cytokinesis). Therefore, in the page of <a
    href="https://www.pombase.org/term/FYPO:0000032">FYPO:0000032</a>, the
    annotations of <a
    href="https://www.pombase.org/term/FYPO:0000118">FYPO:0000118</a> are
    also displayed.</li>
    <li>Read more about FYPO, our phenotype ontology here.</li>

## Advanced search / query builder

You can query ${database_name} annotations using a Graphical User Interface, the “Advanced search” ([https://www.pombase.org/query](https://www.pombase.org/query)). You can make lists of genes that satisfy a certain condition, and perform operations with these lists. Below some examples:

* Disease-associated genes that give a cytoskeleton phenotype in
<em>${genus_and_species}</em>:
