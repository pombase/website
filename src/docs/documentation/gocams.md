## GO-CAM curated biological pathways

Visit the [GO-CAM model list](/gocam/model-list).

GO-CAMs, or Gene Ontology Causal Activity Models, are a framework
developed within the Gene Ontology (GO) project to represent complex
biological pathways in a structured, computable format. Unlike
traditional GO annotations, GO-CAM curation incorporates causal
relationships between molecular activities and connects them to
biological processes and cellular components.

This approach provides a more detailed depiction of how gene products
interact and function within biological systems. GO-CAMs specify
entities like genes and proteins, their associated activities, and the
causal links between them. These models are visualized as graphs, with
nodes representing molecular activities and edges illustrating causal
relationships, enabling a comprehensive understanding of interactions
and pathways in biological processes.

At PomBase, we have begun representing biological pathways as GO-CAM
models and are displaying them on the relevant gene and process pages.

For further information see the
[Gene Ontology Consortium's GO-CAM overview](https://geneontology.org/docs/gocam-overview/).

### Tools and summaries

The [PomBase GO-CAM page](/gocam/) has a list of all available GO-CAM
models and links to the following model information pages:

#### Missing activities

We maintain a list of activities known or suspected to occur in fission yeast but
not yet associated with a gene product. These “pathway holes” have
been identified through GO-CAM causal model curation.

#### GO-CAM Summary Map

The [Summary Map](/gocam/summary/all) is a
high-level graphical summary of the connections between GO-CAM models.

Clicking on the name of a model will take you to the detailed GO-CAM
view of that model.  Clicking on an arrow between models will take you
to a view of connection bewtween the two models.

#### The Mega-Model

This is a combined model created using the
[Model joining activities](/gocam/connections).

#### Model joining activities

The model join table shows the activities in common between models.
These shared activities are where models can be joined to give the
[GO-CAM Summary Map](/gocam/summary/all) and the
[Mega-model](/gocam/mega-model/connected).
