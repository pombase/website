## Phenotype annotations

Phenotype annotations
%%end db=PomBase
%%if db=JaponicusDB
[Phenotype annotations](/data/annotations/Phenotype_annotations/phenotype_annotations.japonicusdb.phaf.gz)
%%end db=JaponicusDB
for alleles of
*${species_abbrev}* genes are manually curated from the literature using
Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO) terms.

%%if db=PomBase
PHAF format phenotype data file from the latest monthly release:

  - [pombase_phenotype_annotation.phaf.tsv](${base_url}/latest_release/phenotypes_and_genotypes/pombase_phenotype_annotation.phaf.tsv)

This file contains phenotypes and genotype details for single locus
haploid genotypes.

The genotypes and phenotypes directory from the latest release
contains other related files:

  - [phenotypes_and_genotypes directory](${base_url}/latest_release/phenotypes_and_genotypes/)


%%end db=PomBase

Note that PHAF format contains annotations for single locus, single allele
phenotypes (single mutants) and homozygous diploids phenotypes only.

This file uses the the ${database_name} phenotype data bulk annotation
format (PHAF), detailed below. This format is similar to the
one that can be used to submit phenotype annotations to ${database_name} in bulk,
as described on the [Phenotype data bulk upload format](/documentation/phenotype-data-bulk-upload-format) 
page, with the addition of the `Database` column. Note that, because
Database is column 1 in the downloadable file, column numbers differ
by 1 between the download and upload formats.

Propagating phenotype annotations: Note that the file contains only
direct annotations to FYPO terms. It does not include annotations that
can be inferred by propagating between terms within the ontology. To
make full use of the FYPO annotation data, we strongly recommend also
using the ontology structure and inferred annotations. Please contact
the [${database_name} helpdesk](mailto:${helpdesk_address}) if you need
assistance.

## Viability summary

%%if db=PomBase
A [set of "viability summary" data](${base_url}/latest_release/phenotypes_and_genotypes/gene_viability.tsv)
%%end db=PomBase
%%if db=JaponicusDB
A [set of "viability summary" data](https://www.pombase.org/data/annotations/Phenotype_annotations/FYPOviability.tsv)
%%end db=JaponicusDB
as shown at the top of the FYPO table on each gene page, is available as
a downloadable file. The file has two columns: the gene systematic ID
and one of three values: "viable", "inviable" or "condition-dependent".

To cite the fission yeast phenotype data (complete or viability
summary), please see [Citing ${database_name}](/about/citing-${lc_database_name}).
