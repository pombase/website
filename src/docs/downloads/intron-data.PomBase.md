## Introns

Downloadable intron datasets are [available in FASTA format](/latest_release/genome_sequence_and_features/fasta_format)


Note that you can also use the Advanced Search to find all genes
containing introns, as described in the 
[FAQ on introns](/faq/how-can-i-retrieve-intron-coordinates-or-sequences).

### Legacy intron data

We also provide access to archived [intron data](https://www.pombase.org/data/archive/Intron_Data/OLD/).
Please note that this set of intron data reflect the dataset at the
time of publication of the *S. pombe* genome sequence, and does not
include any new introns, or changes to introns, since then. The
intron data archive includes:

-   List of all *S. pombe* intron-containing genes
-   List of all *S. pombe* genes with exon numbers
-   *S. pombe* intron sequences in FASTA format (donor
    sequence and final 35 bases of acceptor)
-   All introns with branch site aligned
-   Donor frequency
-   Branch frequency
-   A README file is available with additional descriptions of file
