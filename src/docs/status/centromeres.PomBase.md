## Centromeres

Repeats are also shown in the diagram below. To see the repeat
sequences, download the
[contiguated sequence files](${base_url}/latest_release/genome_sequence_and_features/artemis_contigs/)
and view them in Artemis. (See
[this FAQ](/faq/is-there-an-equivalent-to-the-artemis-java-applet-in-pombase) for more
information.)

**Notes:**

  - Recent work by Chad Ellermeier and Gerry Smith suggests that
    there are only 4 +/- 1 copies of the 6760 bp repeat missing from
    chromosome 3

  - This map is a schematic diagram. Distances and overlaps are
    approximate. Please refer to the sequence data to design experimental
    constructs.
