## Centromeres

Repeats are also shown in the diagram below. To see the repeat
sequences, download and unzip the [contiguated sequence files](https://www.pombase.org/data/genome_sequence_and_features/artemis_files/)
and view them in Artemis. (See
[this FAQ](/faq/is-there-an-equivalent-to-the-artemis-java-applet-in-pombase) for more
information.)

**Note:** Recent work by Chad Ellermeier and Gerry Smith suggests that
there are only 4 +/- 1 copies of the 6760 bp repeat missing from
chromosome 3

Please note: This map is a schematic diagram. Distances and overlaps are
approximate. Please refer to the sequence data to design experimental
constructs.
