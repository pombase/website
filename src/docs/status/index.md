## Genome Status

%%if db=JaponicusDB
Note: Because *S. japonicus* curation has begun so recently, many of these pages do not have data yet. Watch for updates.

| | |
|-|-|
| [Genome overview](status/genome-overview) | Graphic and basic information about each chromosome |
%%if db=PomBase
| [Sequencing status](status/sequencing-status) | Contig size, gap status and progress, including [centromeres](status/centromeres) and [telomeres](status/telomeres) |
| [Sequence updates](status/sequencing-updates) | Changes to the genome sequence since July 2003 |
| [Sequence updates pending](status/sequence-updates-pending) | Pending changes, mainly from the Broad Institute, some supported by data from other sources |
| [Protein coding gene coordinate changes](status/gene-coordinate-changes-protein-coding) | Changes to coordinates of individual protein coding genes since publication |
| [RNA gene coordinate changes](status/gene-coordinate-changes-RNA) | Changes to coordinates of RNA genes since publication |
%%end db=PomBase
| [New and removed genes](status/new-and-removed-genes) | Genes identified or removed since publication |
%%if db=PomBase
| [Gene characterisation](status/protein-status-tracker) | Current counts of protein coding gene status, as published in small scale experiments |
| [Genome statistics](status/statistics) |  Information on the status of the genome (Note: Last updated January 2017) |
| [Priority unstudied genes](status/priority-unstudied-genes) | Unstudied nuclear-encoded protein-coding genes conserved 1:1 in human |
%%end db=PomBase
| [Unmapped genes](status/unmapped_genes) | List of genes identified genetically but not cloned or physically mapped |

Note: Many older *${species_abbrev}* sequence submissions to the DNA databases
(International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration databases,
i.e. ENA, GenBank, DDBJ) contain one or more errors, and we do not have
the resources to maintain past sequences or flag every error in ${database_name}.
