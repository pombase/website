## Genome Status

%%if db=JaponicusDB
Note: Because *S. japonicus* curation has begun so recently, many of these pages do not have data yet. Watch for updates.

| | |
|-|-|
| [Curation metrics](/metrics) | Literature and curation metrics |
| [Genome statistics](status/statistics) | Genome organization, chromosome lengths, gene counts |
%%if db=PomBase
| [Non-gene features](/documentation/non-gene-features) | Informations about non-gene sequence features including centromeres and telomeres
| [Reference genome status](status/sequencing-status) | Status of the final genome assembly: Contig sizes and gap status |
| [Sequence updates](status/sequencing-updates) | Updates to the reference genome sequence since July 2003 |
| [Sequence updates pending](status/sequence-updates-pending) | Pending sequence changes, known sequence errors in the reference genome |
| [Protein coding gene coordinate changes](status/gene-coordinate-changes-protein-coding) | Changes to the coordinates of protein-coding genes since 2002  |
| [RNA gene coordinate changes](status/gene-coordinate-changes-RNA) | Changes to the coordinates of RNA genes since 2002 |
| [New and removed genes](status/new-and-removed-genes) | Protein-coding gene and ncRNA genes newly identified or removed since 2002 |
| [Known/unknown protein roles](status/protein-status-tracker) | Protein-coding gene functional characterization status tracker and related lists (e.g. unknown biological process, unknown molecular activity, missing activities) |
| [Priority unstudied genes](status/priority-unstudied-genes) | Protein-coding genes of unknown biological role conserved 1:1 to human |
%%end db=PomBase
| [Unmapped genes](status/unmapped_genes) | List of genes identified genetically but not cloned or physically mapped |

Note: Many older *${species_abbrev}* sequence submissions to the DNA databases
(International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration databases,
i.e. ENA, GenBank, DDBJ) contain one or more errors, and we do not have
the resources to maintain past sequences or flag every error in ${database_name}.
