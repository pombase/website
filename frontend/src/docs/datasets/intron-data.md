Downloadable intron datasets are available in FASTA format from the
[PomBase FTP site](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pombase/FASTA/).

Note that you can also use the Advanced Search to find all genes
containing introns, as described in the [FAQ on
introns](http://www.pombase.org/faqs/how-can-i-retrieve-intron-coordinates-or-sequences).

----

We also provide access to archived [Intron Data](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pombase/pombe/Archived_directories/Intron_Data/OLD/).
Please note that this set of intron data reflect the dataset at the
time of publication of the *S. pombe* genome sequence, and does not
include any new introns, or changes to introns, since then. The
intron data archive includes:

-   List of all *S. pombe* intron-containing genes
-   List of all *S. pombe* genes with exon numbers
-   *S. pombe* intron sequences in FASTA format (donor
    sequence and final 35 bases of acceptor)
-   All introns with branch site aligned
-   Donor frequency
-   Branch frequency
-   A README file is available with additional descriptions of file
    contents
