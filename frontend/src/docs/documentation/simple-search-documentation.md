The simple search is available via the search box in the header on every
PomBase page:

The simple search works for:

- Fission yeast gene names, synonyms, and systematic IDs
- Fission yeast gene product descriptions
- Human orthologs of fission yeast genes &mdash; search by standard gene symbols
- Budding yeast orthologs of fission yeast genes &mdash; search by standard gene names or ORF names
- Publications &mdash; search by PubMed ID
- Ontology terms &mdash; search by term ID

Start typing to see a pulldown of autocomplete matches, then choose
one, or if there is a single match simply hit return, to go to the
matching gene page.
