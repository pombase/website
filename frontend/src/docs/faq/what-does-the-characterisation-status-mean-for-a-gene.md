# What does the "characterisation status" mean for a gene?
<!-- pombase_categories: Genome statistics and lists -->

Each gene is assigned exactly one characterisation status that reflects
how much is known about the gene, whether it is conserved, etc. Specific
status descriptions:

-   **Published**: Completely or partially
    characterised in a small scale experiment, with some published
    information about the biological role (corresponding to any of the
    [fission yeast GO slim](/browse-curation/fission-yeast-go-slim-terms) biological
    process terms)
-   **Biological role inferred**: A biological role (as above, a
    [fission yeast GO slim](/browse-curation/fission-yeast-go-slim-terms) term) is inferred
    from homology to an experimentally characterised gene product
-   **Conserved unknown**: Conserved outside
    the *Schizosaccharomyces*, but nothing known about the biological
    role in any organism
-   ***Schizosaccharomyces* specific protein, uncharacterised**:
    Unpublished and found only in fission yeast (*S. pombe*, *S. octosporus*, *S. japonicus*, *S. cryophilus*);
    nothing known about biological role. May be single copy or a member
    of a multi-member family.
-   ***S. pombe* specific protein, uncharacterised**:
    Unpublished and found only in *S. pombe* (not
    detected in other *Schizosaccharomyces* species); nothing known
    about biological role
-   **Transposon**: Known or predicted transposable element
-   **Dubious**: Unlikely to be protein coding

A current summary of [gene characterisation status for the *S. pombe* genome](/status/gene-characterisation) is available, as well as a
table of [historical characterisation status](/status/gene-characterisation-statistics-history) counts.

You can also retrieve current lists of genes with each characterisation
status using the [advanced search](/query). Select the
Characterisation status query, then choose a status from the pulldown menu,
and submit.
